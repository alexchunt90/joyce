A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a paper shuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a comer two night watch in shouldercapes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes: a woman screams: a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens.

<p>Humbugging and deluthering as per usual with your cock and bull story.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.</p>

<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Let's walk on. Shall us?</p>

<p>MRS BREEN</p>
<p><em>(In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.)</em> Leopardstown.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...</p>
<p>MRS BREEN</p>
<p>She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.</p>

<p>MRS BREEN</p>
<p>Too...</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across...</p>

<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.</p>

One and eightpence too much. <em>(The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle</em> <em>against his hand, wagging his tail.)</em> Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like <em>rencontres.</em> Stinks like a polecat. <em>Chacun son go&#251;t</em>. He might be mad. Dogdays. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Fido! Good fellow! Garryowen! <em>(The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.)</em> Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. <em>(Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.)</em> Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.</p>

<p>Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.</p>
<p><em>(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pig's knuckle between his molars through which rabid scumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)</em></p>
<p>SECOND WATCH</p>
<p>Prevention of cruelty to animals.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Enthusiastically.)</em> A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.</p>
<p><em>(Signor Maffei, passionpale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paperhoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the gorging boarhound.)</em></p>
<p>SIGNOR MAFFEI</p>
<p><em>(With a sinister smile.)</em> Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pulley will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even <em>Leo ferox</em> there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. <em>(He glares.)</em> I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers.<em>(With a bewitching smile.)</em> I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH</p>
<p>Come. Name and address.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! <em>(He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.)</em> Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Blum Pasha. Umpteen millions. <em>Donnerwetter!</em> Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.</p>

<p>FIRST WATCH</p>
<p><em>(Reads.)</em> Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Unlawfully watching and besetting.</p>
<p>SECOND WATCH</p>
<p>An alibi. You are cautioned.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.)</em> This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. <em>(Plausibly.)</em> You know that old joke, rose of Castile. Bloom. The change of name. Virag. <em>(He murmurs privately and confidentially.)</em> We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. <em>(He shoulders the second watch gently.)</em> Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. <em>(He turns gravely to the first watch.)</em> Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. <em>(To the second watch gaily.)</em> I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in the shake of a lamb's tail.</p>

<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Scared, hats himself, steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.)</em> No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.</p>
<p>MARTHA</p>
<p><em>(Sobbing behind her veil.)</em> Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Behind his hand.)</em> She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. <em>(He murmurs vaguely the pass of Ephraim.)</em> Shitbroleeth.</p>
<p>SECOND WATCH</p>
<p><em>(Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.)</em> You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH</p>
<p>Regiment.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Turns to the gallery.)</em> The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F., with our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.</p>
<p>A VOICE</p>
<p>Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.)</em> My old dad too was a J. P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. <em>(With quiet feeling.)</em> Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH</p>
<p>Profession or trade.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Well, I follow a literary occupation, author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...</p>

<p><em>(Mr Philip Beaufoy,</em> <em>palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He carries a large portfolio labelled</em> Matcham's Masterstrokes.)</p>
<p>BEAUFOY</p>
<p><em>(Drawls.)</em> No, you aren't. Not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it that's all. No born gentleman, no-one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a litterateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Murmurs with hangdog meekness.)</em> That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...</p>
<p>BEAUFOY</p>
<p><em>(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.)</em> You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Indistinctly.)</em> University of life. Bad art.</p>
<p>BEAUFOY</p>
<p><em>(Shouts.)</em> It's a damnably foul lie, showing the moral rottenness of the man! <em>(He extends his portfolio.)</em> We have here damning evidence, the <em>corpus delicti</em>, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.</p>

<p>BEAUFOY</p>
<p>You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! <em>(To the court.)</em> Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society! The archconspirator of the age!</p>

<p>Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?</p>
<p>MARY DRISCOLL</p>
<p><em>(Indignantly.)</em> I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.</p>

<p>MARY DRISCOLL</p>
<p>He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly.)</em> I treated you white.

<p><em>(Excitedly.)</em> As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH</p>
<p>The offence complained of? Did something happen?</p>
<p>MARY DRISCOLL</p>
<p>He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twict with my clothing.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>She counterassaulted.</p>
<p>MARY DRISCOLL</p>
<p><em>(Scornfully.)</em> I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!</p>
<p><em>(General laughter.)</em></p>
<p>GEORGES FOTTRELL</p>
<p><em>(Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.)</em> Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.</p>
<p><em>(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to</em> <em>nature as a purely domestic animal. Asevenmonths' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent.

<p><em>(In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.)</em> This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. <em>Prima facie</em>, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal in especial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.</p>

<p><em>(Hotly to the populace.)</em> This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically, without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. <em>(Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.)</em> I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. <em>(To Bloom.)</em> I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.</p>

A few wellchosen words. <em>(He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.)</em> When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. <em>(A paper with something written on it is handed into court.</em>)</p>

I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest... Queens of Dublin society. <em>(Carelessly.)</em> I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...</p>
<p>MRS YELVERTON BARRY</p>
<p><em>(In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.)</em> Arrest him, constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the <em>Theatre Royal</em> at a command performance of <em>La Cigale</em>. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled <em>The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays</em>.</p>
<p>MRS BELLINGHAM</p>
<p><em>(In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzing-</em> <em>glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.)</em> Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.</p>

<p>MRS BELLINGHAM</p>
<p>He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me (stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me) to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p>THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS</p>
<p><em>(In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.)</em> Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob <em>Centaur.</em> This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude se&#241;orita, frail and lovely (his wife, as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.</p>

<p>PADDY DIGNAM</p>
<p><em>(Earnestly.)</em> Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied.

Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)</em></p>

<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.)</em>Mankind is incorrigible.

<p><em>(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moonblue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair, borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)</em></p>

<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry <em>Bonafide Sabaoth</em>, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.</p>

<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.</p>
<p><em>(Thirty two workmen, wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland,</em> <em>under the guidance of Derwan the builder, construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice with crystal roof, built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds.Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)</em></p>

<p>ALEXANDER J DOWIE</p>
<p><em>(Violently.)</em> Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery, recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!</p>
<p>THE MOB</p>
<p>Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!</p>
<p><em>(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several</em> <em>shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street</em> <em>throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)</em></p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Excitedly.)</em> This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, <em>sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall.</em> I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist, to give medical testimony on my behalf.</p>
<p>DR MULLIGAN</p>
<p><em>(In motor jerkin, green motorgoggles on his brow.)</em> Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be <em>virgo intacta.</em></p>
<p><em>(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)</em></p>

<p>Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.</p>

<p>DR PUNCH COSTELLO</p>
<p>The <em>fetor judaicus</em> is most perceptible.</p>
<p>DR DIXON</p>
<p><em>(Reads a bill of health.)</em> Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish manufacture winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.</p>
<p><em>(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, blank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I. O.

<p><em>(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands,</em> <em>draws him over. He hops. On the antlered rack of the hall hang a man 's hat and waterproof.

Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping.

Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece.

Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber.

<p>Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. <em>(Harshly, his pupils waxing.)</em> To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the Sex Secrets of Monks and Maidens. Why I left the church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. <em>(He wriggles.)</em> Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. <em>(He cries.) Coactus volui.</em> Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grapses woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks.

Apocalypse.</p>

<p>Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.</p>
<p><em>(His Eminence Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red</em> <em>soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with large wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)</em></p>
<p>THE CARDINAL</p>
<p>Conservio lies captured<br>
He lies in the lowest dungeon<br>
With manacles and chains around his limbs<br>
Weighing upwards of three tons.<br>

<p><em>(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, arms akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.)</em></p>
<p>O, the poor little fellow<br>
Hihihihihis legs they were yellow<br>
He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake<br>
But some bloody savage<br>
To graize his white cabbage<br>
He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.<br>
</p>
<p><em>(A multitude of midges swarms white over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.)</em></p>
<p>I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.</p>
<p><em>(His head aslant he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his trainbearers.

<p>The devil is in that door.</p>
<p><em>(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)</em></p>
<p>ZOE</p>
<p><em>(Sniffs his hair briskly.)</em> Hmmm! Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.</p>

She taunts him.)</em> Have it now or wait till you get it? <em>(He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows.

<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then rigid with left foot advanced he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.)</em> Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are!</p>

<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Takes the chocolate.)</em> Aphrodisiac? Tansy and pennyroyal. But I bought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. <em>(He eats.)</em> Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.</p>
<p><em>(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress, enters.

Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed with orangetainted nostrils. She has large pendant beryl eardrops.)</em></p>

<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Yes. Partly, I have mislaid...</p>

<p><em>(Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)</em></p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Wincing.)</em> Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.</p>
<p>THE FAN</p>
<p><em>(Tapping.)</em> We have met. You are mine. It is fate.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Cowed.)</em> Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle as you probably... <em>(He winces.)</em> Ah!</p>
<p>RICHIE GOULDING</p>
<p><em>(Bagweighted, passes the door.)</em> Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's. Liver and kidney.</p>
<p>THE FAN</p>
<p><em>(Tapping.)</em> All things end. Be mine. Now.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Undecided.)</em> All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.</p>
<p>THE FAN</p>
<p><em>(Points downwards slowly.)</em> You may.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace.)</em> We are observed.</p>
<p>THE FAN</p>
<p><em>(Points downwards quickly.)</em> You must.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(With desire, with reluctance.)</em> I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellett's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!</p>
<p><em>(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)</em></p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Murmurs lovingly.)</em> To be a shoefitter in Manfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.</p>
<p>THE HOOF</p>
<p>Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>

<p>If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.</p>

<p>THE SINS OF THE PAST</p>
<p><em>(In a medley of voices.)</em> He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in D'Olier street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he frankly encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?</p>

You will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways.

<p>I will but is it wise? <em>(He counts.)</em> One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.</p>
<p>STEPHEN</p>
<p>Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. <em>(He laughs loudly.)</em> Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>

<p><em>(The pianola with changing lights plays in waltz time the prelude of</em> My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. <em>Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe round the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, arming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her round the room. Bloom stands aside. Her sleeve filling from gracing arms reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Between the curtains Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a gorget of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief, tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is an immense dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand lightly on his breastbone, bows, and fondles his flower and buttons.)</em></p>

<p><em>(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms shrivels, sinks, his live cape filling about the stool. The air in firmer waltz time sounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)</em></p>

With teeth as sharp as razors<br>
To slit the throats<br>
Of the English dogs<br>
That hanged our Irish leaders.</p>
<p>THE CROPPY BOY</p>
<p><em>(The ropenoose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)</em></p>
<p>I bear no hate to a living thing,<br>
But I love my country beyond the king.</p>
<p>RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER</p>
<p><em>(Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with gladstone bag which he opens.)</em> Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from body of Miss Barron which sent Seddon to the gallows.</p>
<p><em>(He jerks the rope. The assistants leap at the victim's legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boy's tongue protrudes violently.)</em></p>
<p>THE CROPPY BOY</p>
<p>Horhot ho hray hor hother's hest.</p>
<p><em>(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his deathclothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)</em></p>
<p>RUMBOLD</p>
<p>I'm near it myself. <em>(He undoes the noose.)</em> Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time. As applied to Her Royal Highness. <em>(He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.)</em>My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!</p>
<p>EDWARD THE SEVENTH</p>
<p><em>(Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket, and sings with soft contentment.)</em></p>
<p>On coronation day, on coronation day,<br>
O, won't we have a merry time,<br>
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!</p>
<p>PRIVATE CARR</p>
<p>Here. What are you saying about my king?</p>
<p>STEPHEN</p>
<p><em>(Throws up his hands.)</em> O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. <em>(He searches his pockets vaguely.)</em> Gave it to someone.</p>

<p><em>(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout.

A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner, in athlete's singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. Laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks.</em> <em>Quakerlysterplasters blisters.

<p>Who are you? Do you know him?</p>
<p>PRIVATE CARR</p>
<p><em>(Lurches towards the watch.)</em> He insulted my lady friend.</p>

<p><em>(Pulling his comrade.)</em> Here, bugger off Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.</p>

<p>SECOND WATCH</p>
<p>Night, Mr Kelleher.</p>
<p>CORNY KELLEHER</p>
<p><em>(To the watch, with drawling eye.)</em> That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. <em>(He laughs.)</em> Twenty to one. Do you follow me?</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH</p>

<p><em>(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)</em></p>
<p>CORNY KELLEHER</p>
<p>Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. <em>(He laughs, shaking his head.)</em> We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH</p>
<p><em>(Laughs.)</em> I suppose so.</p>
<p>CORNY KELLEHER</p>
<p><em>(Nudges the second watch.)</em> Come and wipe your name off the slate. <em>(He lilts, wagging his head.)</em> With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?</p>

<p>All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.</p>
<p>CORNY KELLEHER</p>
<p>I'll see to that.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.)</em> Thank you very much, gentlemen. Thank you. <em>(He mumbles confidentially.)</em> We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a wellknown highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH</p>
<p>O, I understand, sir.</p>
<p>SECOND WATCH</p>
<p>That's all right, sir.</p>
<p>FIRST WATCH</p>

<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Blows.)</em> Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?...</p>
<p>CORNY KELLEHER</p>
<p><em>(Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.)</em> Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief. And were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...</p>
<p>CORNY KELLEHER</p>
<p><em>(Laughs.)</em> Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. <em>(He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.)</em> Thanks be to God we have it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me? Hah, hah, hah!</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Tries to laugh.)</em> He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow, he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...</p>
<p><em>(The horse neighs.)</em></p>
<p>THE HORSE</p>
<p>Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!</p>
<p>CORNY KELLEHER</p>
<p>Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. <em>(He laughs.)</em> Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.</p>
<p><em>(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)</em></p>
<p>CORNY KELLEHER</p>
<p><em>(Scratches his nape.)</em> Sandycove! <em>(He bends down and calls to Stephen.)</em> Eh! <em>(He calls again.)</em> Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.</p>
<p>CORNY KELLEHER</p>
<p>Ah, well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. <em>(He laughs.)</em> I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!</p>
<p>THE HORSE</p>
<p><em>(Neighs.)</em> Hohohohohome.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...</p>
<p><em>(Corny Kelleher</em> <em>returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)</em></p>
<p>CORNY KELLEHER</p>
<p><em>(From the car, standing.)</em> Night.</p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Night.</p>
<p><em>(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn.</em> <em>Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom's plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slownod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The carjingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen's hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)</em></p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Eh! Ho! <em>(There is no answer; he bends again.)</em> Mr Dedalus! <em>(There is no answer.)</em> The name if you call. Somnambulist. <em>(He bends again and hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.)</em> Stephen! <em>(There is no answer. He calls again.)</em> Stephen!</p>
<p>STEPHEN</p>
<p><em>(Groans.)</em> Who? Black panther. Vampire. <em>(He sighs and stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.)</em></p>
<p>Who... drive... Fergus now<br>
And pierce... wood's woven shade?...</p>
<p><em>(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)</em></p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p>Poetry. Well educated. Pity. <em>(He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.)</em> To breathe. <em>(He brushes the woodshavings from Stephen's clothes with light hand and fingers.)</em> One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. <em>(He listens.)</em> What?</p>
<p>STEPHEN</p>
<p><em>(Murmurs.)</em></p>
<p>... shadows... the woods<br>
... white breast... dim sea.</p>
<p><em>(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom, holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)</em></p>
<p>BLOOM</p>
<p><em>(Communes with the night.)</em> Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him. <em>(He murmurs.)</em>... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... <em>(He murmurs.)</em>... in the rough sands of the sea... a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs... and flows ...</p>
<p><em>(Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)</em></p>

<p>RUDY</p>
<p><em>(Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling.</em> <em>He has a delicate mauve face.
