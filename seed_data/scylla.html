<p class="newchapter">
Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>?
A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms
against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in
real life.
</p>
<p>
He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step
backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.
</p>
<p>
A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a
noiseless beck.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful
ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always
feels that Goethe's judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.
</p>
<p>
Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door
he gave his large ear all to the attendant's words: heard them: and was
gone.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg164">  </span><p>
Two left.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes
before his death.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with
elder's gall, to write <i>Paradise Lost</i> at your dictation? <i>The Sorrows
of Satan</i> he calls it.
</p>
<p>
Smile. Smile Cranly's smile.
</p>
<p class="lyrics"> <i>First he tickled her <br />
     Then he patted her <br />
     Then he passed the female catheter. <br />

</p>
<span id="ed1922pg176"> </span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I feel you would need one more for <i>Hamlet.</i> Seven is dear to the
mystic mind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.
</p>
<p>
Glittereyed, his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought
the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed
low: a sizar's laugh of Trinity: unanswered.
</p>
<p class="lyrics"> <i>Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood <br />
     Tears such as angels weep.  <br />
     Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.</i>
</p>

<p>
Mulligan has my telegram.
</p>
<p>
Folly. Persist.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a
figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare's Hamlet though
I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his
shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.
Clergymen's discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal
to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a
work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of
Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley,
the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal
<span id="ed1932pg165">  </span>wisdom, Plato's world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of
schoolboys for schoolboys.
</p>
<p>
A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike
me!
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.
Aristotle was once Plato's schoolboy.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One
can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg177"> </span>
<p>
He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.
</p>
<p>
Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the
heavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who
suffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon
the altar. I am the sacrificial butter.
</p>
<p>
Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name
Ineffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no
secret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching
to see if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of
light, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the
plane of buddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P.
must work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very
illustrious sister H.P.B.'s elemental.
</p>
<p>
O, fie! Out on't! <i>Pfuiteufel!</i> You naughtn't to look, missus, <span id="ed1961pg185">  </span>so you
naughtn't when a lady's ashowing of her elemental.
</p>
<p>
Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with
grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet's musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato's.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg152"> </span><p>
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle
with Plato.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his
commonwealth?
</p>
<p>
Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of
allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. <a id="020069streetshout3" class="box-images" href="notes/020069streetshout.htm">God: noise in the
street</a>: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through
spaces smaller than red globules of man's blood they creepycrawl after
Blake's buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a
shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to
the past.
</p>
<p>
Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg166">  </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Haines is gone, he said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Is he?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I was showing him Jubainville's book. He's quite enthusiastic, don't
you know, about <a id="090003hyde1" class="box-images" href="notes/090003hyde.htm">Hyde's <i>Lovesongs of Connacht.</i></a> I couldn't bring him in
to hear the discussion. He's gone to Gill's to buy it.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg178"> </span>
<p class="lyrics"> <i>Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick <br />
     To greet the callous public. <br />
     Writ, I ween, 'twas not my wish <br />
     In lean unlovely English.</i>
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.
</p>
<p>
We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green
twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of
Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the
world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on the
hillside. For them the earth <span id="ed1961pg186">  </span>is not an exploitable ground but the
living mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the
sixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower
of corruption in Mallarm&eacute; but the desirable life is revealed only to the
poor of heart, the life of Homer's Ph&aelig;acians.
</p>
<p>
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Mallarm&eacute;, don't you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose
poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about
<i>Hamlet.</i> He says: <i>il se prom&egrave;ne, lisant au livre de lui-m&ecirc;me</i>, don't
you know, <i>reading the book of himself</i>. He describes <i>Hamlet</i> given in
a French town, don't you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.
</p>
<p>
His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;text-indent:0px;line-height:130%;margin-top:.6cm;margin-bottom:.6cm;">
<i>Hamlet<br />

</p>
<span id="ed1986pg153"> </span><p>
He repeated to John Eglinton's newgathered frown:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<i>Pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</i>, don't you know. It's so French. The French
point of view. <i>Hamlet ou</i>...
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The <a id="090001absentminded" class="box-images" href="notes/090001absentminded.htm">absentminded beggar</a>, Stephen ended.
</p>
<p>
John Eglinton laughed.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but
distressingly shortsighted in some matters.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg167">  </span><p>
<a id="090001absentminded2" class="box-images" href="notes/090001absentminded.htm">Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.</a>
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg179"> </span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not
for nothing was he a butcher's son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and
spitting in his palm. Nine lives are taken off for his father's one.
Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to
shoot. The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the
concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.

<i>Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none<br />

</p>
<p>
Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He will have it that <i>Hamlet</i> is a ghoststory, John Eglinton <span id="ed1961pg187">  </span>said
for Mr Best's behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our
flesh creep.
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
<i>List! List! O list!</i>
</p>
<p>
My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
<i>If thou didst ever...</i>
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded
into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris
lies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from <i>limbo patrum</i>, returning
to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?
</p>
<p>
John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.
</p>
<p>
Lifted.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with
a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the
bankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.
Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the
groundlings.
</p>
<p>
Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Shakespeare has left the huguenot's house in Silver street and walks
by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the
pen <span id="ed1986pg154"> </span>chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon
has other thoughts.
</p>
<p>
Composition of place. <a id="010008jesuit5" class="box-images" href="notes/010008jesuit.htm">Ignatius Loyola</a>, make haste to help me!
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg180"> </span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in <span id="ed1932pg168">  </span>the
castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the
ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who
has studied <i>Hamlet</i> all the years of his life which were not vanity in
order to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage,
the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth,
calling him by a name:
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
<i>Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit</i>
</p>
bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,
young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has
died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg188">  </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son's name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been
prince Hamlet's twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you
are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the
guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began
impatiently.
</p>
<p>
Art thou there, truepenny?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I
mean when we read the poetry of <i>King Lear</i> what is it to us how the
poet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de
l'Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day,
the poet's drinking, the poet's debts. We have <i>King Lear</i>: and it is
immortal.
</p>
<p>
Mr Best's face, appealed to, agreed.

&#8212;&nbsp;Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?
John Eglinton's carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid
for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She
saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore
his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed
when he lay on his deathbed.
</p>
<p>
Mother's deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into

</p>
<p>
I wept alone.
</p>
<p>
John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
out of it as quickly and as best he could.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His
errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.
</p>
<p>
<a id="060006toadeyes3" class="box-images" href="notes/060006toadeyes.htm">Portals of discovery opened</a> to let in the quaker librarian,
softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn
from Xanthippe?
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg182"> </span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
into the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (<i>absit
nomen!</i>), Socratididion's Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever
know. But neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlelectures saved him
from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best's quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem
to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg170">  </span><p>
His look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull, to remind, to
chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless
though maligned.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.
He carried a memory in his wallet as he <span id="ed1961pg190">  </span>trudged to Romeville whistling
<i>The</i> <span id="ed1986pg156"> </span><i>girl I left behind me.</i> If the earthquake did not time it we should
know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds,
the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, <i>Venus and
Adonis</i>, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London.
Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and
beautiful. Do you think the writer of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, a
passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose
the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her
and gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy.
Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He
was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way.
By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and
twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping
to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford
wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.
</p>
<p>
And my turn? When?
</p>
<p>
Come!
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,
brightly.

He murmured then with blond delight for all:

at Moore's tonight? Piper is coming.

think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: <i>As in wild earth

Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says.
Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in
Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O'Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the

The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask said:

&#8212;&nbsp;Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.

He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:

&#8212;&nbsp;Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?
</p>
<p>
Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg158"> </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been
first a sundering.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes.
</p>
<p>
Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,
from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women
he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,
bully tapsters' wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack
dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as
cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow
grave and unforgiven.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes. So you think...
</p>
<p>
The door closed behind the outgoer.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg185"> </span>
<p>
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and
brooding air.
</p>
<p>
A vestal's lamp.
</p>
<p>
Here he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have lived to do
had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of
the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when
he lived among women.
</p>
<p>
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the
voice of that Egyptian highpriest. <i>In painted chambers loaded with
tilebooks.</i>
</p>
<p>
They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an <span id="ed1961pg193">  </span>itch of
<span id="ed1932pg173">  </span>death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak
their will.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most
enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so
much. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;But <i>Hamlet</i> is so personal, isn't it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind
of private paper, don't you know, of his private life. I mean, I don't
care a button, don't you know, who is killed or who is guilty...
</p>
<p>
He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his
defiance. His private papers in the original. <i>Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim
in mo shagart</i>. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.
</p>
<p>
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but
I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.
</p>
<p>
Bear with me.
</p>
<p>
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under
wrinkled brows. A basilisk. <i>E quando vede l'uomo l'attosca</i>. Messer
Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,
from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist
weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where
<span id="ed1986pg159"> </span>it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff
time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image
of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination,
when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that
which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the
future, the sister of the past, I may see 
<span id="ed1922pg186"> </span>
myself as I sit here now but
by reflection from that which then I shall be.
</p>
<p>
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness
might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from
the son.
</p>
<p>
Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.
</p>
<p>
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg194">  </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a
drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare's later years which Renan
admired so much breathe another spirit.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg174">  </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a
sundering.
</p>
<p>
Said that.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over
the hell of time of <i>King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,</i>
look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a
man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,
prince of Tyre?
</p>
<p>
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant
quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead
to the town.
</p>
<p>
Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon's wild oats. Cypherjugglers
going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good
masters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the
sun, west of the moon: <i>Tir na n-og</i>. Booted the twain and staved.
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
<i>How many miles to Dublin?<br />
Three score and ten, sir. <br />
Will we be there by candlelight?</i>
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing
period.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his
name is, say of it?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,
that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter's
child. 
<span id="ed1922pg187"> </span><span id="ed1986pg160"> </span>
<i>My dearest wife</i>, Pericles says, <i>was like this maid.</i> Will any
man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. <i>L'art d'&ecirc;tre
grand</i>...
</p>
<p>&#8212;&nbsp;His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of
  all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The
  images of other males of his blood <span id="ed1961pg195">  </span>will repel him. He will see in them
  grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or repeat himself.</p>
<p>
  The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of
the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr <span id="ed1932pg175">  </span>George
Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on
Shakespeare in the <i>Saturday Review</i> were surely brilliant. Oddly
enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the
sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own
that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in
harmony with&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;what shall I say?&nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;our 
notions of what ought not to have been.
</p>
<p>
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk's egg, prize
of their fray.
</p>
<p>
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost
love thy man?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That may be too, Stephen said. There is a saying of Goethe's which Mr
Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because
you will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is
a <i>buonaroba,</i> a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a
scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord
of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and had written
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He
was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will
never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game
of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later
undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded
him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there
remains to her woman's invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words,
some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow
of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like
fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.
</p>
<p>
They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
<span id="ed1922pg188"> </span>
porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot
know the <span id="ed1986pg161"> </span>manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls
with that knowledge <span id="ed1961pg196">  </span>in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast
with two backs that urged it King Hamlet's ghost could not know of were
he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech
(his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward.
Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from
Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen's breast, bare, with its
mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up
to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But, because
loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished
<span id="ed1932pg176">  </span>personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he
has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by
Elsinore's rocks or what you will, the sea's voice, a voice heard
only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son
consubstantial with the father.

<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion.
Mr Mulligan, I'll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of
Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg162"> </span><p>
He smiled on all sides equally.
</p>
<p>
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.
</p>
<p>
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg177">  </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. <a id="140034tareandages3" class="box-images" href="notes/140034tareandages.htm">The chap that writes like
Synge.</a>
</p>
<p>
Mr Best turned to him.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He'll see you after at
the D. B. C. He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's <i>Lovesongs of Connacht</i>.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The bard's fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired
perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played
Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining
held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an
Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He
swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde's, Mr Best said,
lifting his brilliant notebook. That <i>Portrait of Mr W. H.</i> where he
proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.
</p>
<p>
Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of
course it's all paradox, don't you know, Hughes and hews and hues,
the colour, but it's so typical the way he works it out. It's the very
essence of Wilde, don't you know. The light touch.
</p>
<p>
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.
Tame essence of Wilde.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg198">  </span><p>
You're darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan

</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking.
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.
</p>
<p>
They talked seriously of mocker's seriousness.
</p>
<p>
Buck Mulligan's again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head
wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His
mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg178">  </span><p>
He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg163"> </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<i>The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the
immense debtorship for a thing done.</i> Signed: Dedalus. Where did you

quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram!

offering a card. From the <i>Freeman.</i> He wants to see the files of the

&#8212;&nbsp;Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...

asked, creaked, asked:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Is he?... O, there!
</p>
<p>
Brisk in a galliard he was off and out. In the daylit corridor he talked
with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most
honest broadbrim.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg164"> </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;This gentleman? <i>Freeman's Journal? Kilkenny People?</i> To be sure. Good

A patient silhouette waited, listening.

Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing
dark figure following his hasty heels.

<p>
The door closed.

<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval.
We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if
at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty
from Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy
in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty
years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary
equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His
art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the
art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar
of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter
<span id="ed1932pg180">  </span>Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his
back including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had
underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied
there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love
and its foul pleasures. You know Manningham's story of the burgher's
wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in <i>Richard
III</i> and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing,
took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate,
answered from the capon's blankets: <i>William the conqueror came before
Richard III</i>. And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O,
and his dainty birdsnies, lady <span id="ed1986pg165"> </span>Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is
suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.

&#8212;&nbsp;Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice
spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.
</p>
<p>
Love that dare not speak its name.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a
lord.
</p>
<p>
Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all
other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the
stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a
shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two
deeds are rank in that ghost's mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained
yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband's brother. <span id="ed1932pg181">  </span>Sweet
Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.
</p>
<p>
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you
deny that in the fifth scene of <i>Hamlet</i> he has branded her with infamy
tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years
between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those
women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her
poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the
first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her
sons, Susan, her husband too, while <span id="ed1961pg202">  </span>Susan's daughter, Elizabeth, to use
granddaddy's words, wed her second, having killed her first.
</p>
<p>
O, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in
royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her
father's shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he
has commended her to posterity.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg166"> </span><p>
He faced their silence.
</p>
<p>
To whom thus Eglinton:

     That has been explained, I believe, by jurists.<br />
     She was entitled to her widow's dower<br />
     At common law. His legal knowledge was great<br />

     And in London. And therefore when he was urged, <br />

     He left her his <br />

<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as
they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms
and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist
shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her
his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in
peace?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr
Secondbest Best said finely.
</p><span id="ed1961pg203">  </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<i>Separatio a mensa et a thalamo</i>, bettered Buck Mulligan and was
smiled on.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.
Let me think.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,
Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays
tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his
dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don't forget
Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg195"> </span><span id="ed1986pg167"> </span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for
a king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What? asked Besteglinton.
</p>
<p>
William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people's William. For
terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought
of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands
and said: <i>All we can say is that life ran very high in those days.</i>
Lovely!

&#8212;&nbsp;The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to
ugling Eglinton.
</p>
<p>
Steadfast John replied severe:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake
and have it.
</p>
<p>
Sayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his
own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself
a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in <span id="ed1932pg183">  </span>the
famine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship
mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted
his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could
Aubrey's ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to
his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging
and quartering of the queen's leech Lopez, his jew's heart being plucked
forth while the sheeny was yet alive: <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> with
the coming <span id="ed1961pg204">  </span>to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for
witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in <i>Love's Labour Lost</i>.
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking
enthusiasm. <a id="010008jesuit6" class="box-images" href="notes/010008jesuit.htm">Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter's theory

<p>
<i>Sufflaminandus sum.</i>
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French
polisher of Italian scandals.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him
myriadminded.

<p>
All smiled their smiles.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose <a id="010102aquinas3" class="box-images" href="notes/010102aquinas.htm">gorbellied works</a> I enjoy
reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different
from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his
wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the
love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld <span id="ed1932pg184">  </span>from some
stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with
avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations
are made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the
jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their
affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old
Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so tightly
to what he <span id="ed1961pg205">  </span>calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold
tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his
wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his
manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will's
widow, is the will to die.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<i>Requiescat!</i> Stephen prayed.

&#8212;&nbsp;She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the
mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as
rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven
parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed
at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town paid for but in
which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. She
read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the <i>Merry
Wives</i> and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought
over <i>Hooks and Eyes for Believers' Breeches</i> and <i>The most Spiritual
Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze</i>. Venus has twisted her
lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience. It is an age
of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;History shows that to be true, <i>inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos</i>. The
ages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man's
worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that
Russell is <span id="ed1986pg169"> </span>right. What do we care for his wife and father? I should say
that only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man.
I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.

<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary
evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father's death.
If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with
thirtyfive years of life, <i>nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita</i>, with
fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then
you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No.
The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to
hour it rots and rots. He rests, 
<span id="ed1922pg198"> </span>
disarmed of fatherhood, having devised
that mystical estate upon his son. Boccaccio's Calandrino was the first
and last man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense of
conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, an
apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On that
mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect
flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably
because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void.
Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood. <i>Amor matris</i>, subjective and
objective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be
a legal fiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love
him or he any son?
</p>
<p>
What the hell are you driving at?
</p>
<p>
I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.

&#8212;&nbsp;They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal
annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,
hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters,
lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with
grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, <a id="010020ancientgreek5" class="box-images" href="notes/010020ancientgreek.htm">queens with prize bulls</a>. The son
unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases
care. He is a <span id="ed1961pg207">  </span>male: his growth is his father's decline, his youth
his father's envy, his friend his father's enemy.

&#8212;&nbsp;Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the
field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of
Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if
the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a
father be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet
of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote <i>Hamlet</i> he was not the
father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt
himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather,
the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was
born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.

He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;As for his family, Stephen said, his mother's name lives in the
forest of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in
<i>Coriolanus.</i> His boyson's death is the deathscene of young Arthur in
<i>King John.</i> Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the
girls in <i>The Tempest</i>, in <i>Pericles,</i> in <i>Winter's Tale</i> are we know.
Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may
guess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded.

That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that

On.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he
took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?
Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann
(what's in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard
the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The
other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his
kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence,
the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of <i>King Lear</i> in which
Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i> and spatchcocked on to a
Celtic legend older than history?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine
a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. <i>Que
voulez-vous?</i> Moore would say. He <span id="ed1961pg211">  </span>puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes
Ulysses quote Aristotle.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or
the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
Shakespeare, what the poor is not, always with him. The note of
banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds
uninterruptedly from <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> onward till Prospero
breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his
book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in
another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it
was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will
and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of
my lords bishops of Maynooth: an original sin and, like original sin,
<span id="ed1932pg190">  </span>committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the
lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under
which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty
and peace have not done it away. It is in 
<span id="ed1922pg203"> </span>
infinite variety everywhere in
the world he has created, in <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, twice in <i>As you
like It</i>, in <i>The Tempest</i>, in <i>Hamlet,</i> in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, 
and in all the other plays which I have not read.
</p>
<p>
He laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage.
</p>
<p>
Judge Eglinton summed up.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He
is all in all.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.
All in all. In <i>Cymbeline,</i> in <i>Othello</i> he is bawd and cuckold. He acts
and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jos&eacute; he
kills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago
ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg174"> </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!
</p>
<p>
Dark dome received, reverbed.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When
all is said Dumas <i>fils</i> (or is it Dumas <i>p&egrave;re?)</i> is right. After God
Shakespeare has created most.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. <span id="ed1961pg212">  </span>He returns after
a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has
always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of
life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The
motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet <i>p&egrave;re?</i> and Hamlet <i>fils.</i>
A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what
though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for,
Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom
they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it:
prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa's lump of
love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the
place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world
without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck
says: <i>If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated
on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps
will tend.</i> Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through
ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives,
widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright
who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light
first <span id="ed1932pg191">  </span>and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom
the most Roman of catholics call <a id="010041killergod2" class="box-images" href="notes/010041killergod.htm"><i>dio boia</i>, hangman god</a>, is doubtless
<a id="020069streetshout4" class="box-images" href="notes/020069streetshout.htm">all in all in all of us</a>, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and
<span id="ed1922pg204"> </span>
cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there
are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife
unto himself.
</p>
<p>
<i>&#8212;&nbsp;Eureka!</i> Buck Mulligan cried. <i>Eureka!</i>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's
desk.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;May I? he said. <a id="010021malachi5" class="box-images" href="notes/010021malachi.htm">The Lord has spoken to Malachi.</a>
</p>
<p>
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.
</p>
<p>
Take some slips from the counter going out.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one,
shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.
</p>
<p>
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.
</p>
<p>
Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his
variorum edition of <i>The Taming of the Shrew.</i>
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have
brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe
your own theory?
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg213">  </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;No, Stephen said promptly.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a
dialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg175"> </span><p>
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment
for it since you don't believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is
some mystery in <i>Hamlet</i> but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man
Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes
that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to
visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor
wrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he
believes his theory.
</p>
<p>
I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help
me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? <i>Egomen.</i> Who to unbelieve? Other
chap.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;You are the only contributor to <i>Dana</i> who asks for pieces of silver.
Then I don't know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an
article on economics.
</p>
<p>
Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg192">  </span><p>
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then
gravely said, honeying malice:
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg205"> </span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in <a id="150005nighttown3" class="box-images" href="notes/150005nighttown.htm">upper
Mecklenburgh street</a> and found him deep in the study of the <a id="010102aquinas4" class="box-images" href="notes/010102aquinas.htm"><i>Summa contra
Gentiles</i></a> in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and
Rosalie, the coalquay whore.
</p>
<p>
He broke away.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Come, Kinch. Come, wandering &AElig;ngus of the birds.
</p>
<p>
Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts
and offals.
</p>
<p>
Stephen rose.
</p>
<p>
Life is many days. This will end.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. <i>Notre ami</i> Moore says
Malachi Mulligan must be there.
</p>
<p>
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to <span id="ed1961pg214">  </span>the youth of
Ireland. I'll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk
straight?
</p>
<p>
Laughing, he...
</p>
<p>
Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.
</p>
<p>
Lubber...
</p>
<p>
Stephen followed a lubber...
</p>
<p>
One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After his
lub back I followed. I gall his kibe.
</p>
<p>
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt
head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of
no thoughts.
</p>
<p>
What have I learned? Of them? Of me?
</p>
<p>
Walk like Haines now.

&#8212;&nbsp;O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...

Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A pleased bottom.
</p>
<p>

He spluttered to the air:

playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers' hall. Our players are creating a
new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I
smell the pubic sweat of monks.
</p>
<p>
He spat blank.
</p>
<p>
Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And
left the <i>femme de trente ans.</i> And why no other children born? And his
first child a girl?
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Longworth and M'Curdy Atkinson were there...
</p>
<p>
Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:
</p>
<p class="lyrics"><i>I hardly hear the purlieu cry <br />
     Or a tommy talk as I pass one by<br />
     Before my thoughts begin to run<br />
     On F. M'Curdy Atkinson,<br />

     And that filibustering filibeg<br />

<p>

A laugh tripped over his lips.

<span id="ed1922pg207"> </span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that
old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you

</p>

He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:

</p>
<span id="ed1961pg216">  </span><p>
He turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.

He read, <i>marcato:</i>

<p>
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:
and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift 
<span id="ed1922pg208"> </span>
their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,
multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted
them.
</p>
<p>
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.
</p>
<p>
Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today,
if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must
come to, ineluctably.

My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.
