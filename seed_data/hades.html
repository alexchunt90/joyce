<p class="newchapter">
Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after
him, curving his height with care.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Come on, Simon.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;After you, Mr Bloom said.
</p>
<p>
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:
</p>
<p>
Yes, yes.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to
after him and <a id="040011rightright2" class="box-images" href="notes/040011rightright.htm">slammed it tight till it shut tight.</a> He passed an arm
through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow
at <a id="060019theavenue" class="box-images" href="notes/060019theavenue.htm">the lowered blinds of the avenue</a>. One dragged aside: an old woman
peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she
was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad
to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.
<a id="060029huggermugger" class="box-images" href="notes/060029huggermugger.htm">Huggermugger in corners.</a> Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd
wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making
the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who
will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe<span id="ed1932pg77"></span> they clip the nails and
the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grow all the same after. Unclean
job.
</p>
<p>
All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am
sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift
it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.
</p>
<p>
All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:
then horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and
swaying.  

<span id="ed1922pg84"></span>
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of
the avenue passed and <a id="060019theavenue2" class="box-images" href="notes/060019theavenue.htm">number nine</a> with its craped knocker, door ajar. At
walking pace.
</p>
<p>
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
passing along the tramtracks. <a id="060025whatway2" class="box-images" href="notes/060025whatway.htm">Tritonville road.</a> Quicker. The wheels
rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
rattling in the doorframes.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<a id="060025whatway" class="box-images" href="notes/060025whatway.htm">Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.</a>
</p>
<p>
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg87"></span>
<span id="ed1986pg72"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died
out.
</p>
<p>
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
passers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the
smoother road past <a id="060025whatway3" class="box-images" href="notes/060025whatway.htm">Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,</a>
clad in mourning, a <a id="010097latinquarterhat7" class="box-images" href="notes/010097latinquarterhat.htm">wide hat</a>.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Who is that?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Your son and heir.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.
</p>
<p>
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway
before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back
to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus
fell back, saying:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Was that Mulligan cad with him? His <i>fidus Achates</i>!
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump
of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on <a id="060025whatway4" class="box-images" href="notes/060025whatway.htm">Ringsend road. Wallace Bros the
bottleworks. Dodder bridge.</a>
</p>
<p>
Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls
the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was.<span id="ed1932pg78"></span> Waltzing
in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the
landlady's two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.
<a id="030076backachepills2" class="box-images" href="notes/030076backachepills.htm">Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing
his back. Thinks he'll cure it with pills.</a> All breadcrumbs they are.
About six hundred per cent profit.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a
contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks all 

<span id="ed1922pg85"></span>
<!-- topofpage -->
over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll
make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother
or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.
I'll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.
</p>
<p>
He cried above the clatter of the wheels:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's
son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.
</p>
<p>
He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to<span id="ed1961pg88"></span> Mr Power's mild
face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy
selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If
little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange
feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning
in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by
the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She<span id="ed1986pg73"></span> had
that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch,
Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins.
</p>
<p>
Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.
I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn
German too.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Are we late? Mr Power asked.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.
</p>
<p>
Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping
Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a
woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.
Life, life.
</p>
<p>
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. Do
you follow me?
</p>
<p>
He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away
crustcrumbs from under his thighs.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg79"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power
said.
</p>
<p>
All raised their thighs, eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward
and said:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg86"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite
clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.
</p>
<p>
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg89"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
his beard gently.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;At <a id="060025whatway5" class="box-images" href="notes/060025whatway.htm">the cemetery</a>, Martin Cunningham said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.
</p>
<p>
The carriage halted short.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What's wrong?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;We're stopped.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Where are we?
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<a id="060016crossgunsbridge3" class="box-images" href="notes/060016crossgunsbridge.htm">The grand canal</a>, he said.
</p>
<p>
Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got
it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame
really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed
tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't<span id="ed1986pg74"></span> miss
this chance. Dogs' home over there. <a id="060004athos1" class="box-images" href="notes/060004athos.htm">Poor old Athos!</a> Be good to Athos,
Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave.
A dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's
dogs usually are.
</p>
<p>
A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower
spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander.
I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The weather is changing, he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming
out.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg80"></span>
<p>
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a
mute curse at the sky.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;We're off again.
</p>
<p>
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
gently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg87"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking
him off to his face.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till<span id="ed1961pg90"></span> you hear
him, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of <i>The Croppy Boy</i>.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. <i>His singing of that simple
ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the
whole course of my experience.</i>
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the
retrospective arrangement.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;In the paper this morning.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change
for her.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton,
Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.
Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of
his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind: Quinlan. On
whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
<i>It is now a month since dear Henry fled <br /> 
To his home up above in the sky <br />
While his family weeps and mourns his loss <br />
Hoping some day to meet him on high.</i>
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg75"></span>
<p>
I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it
in the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry
fled. Before my patience are exhausted.
</p>
<p>
<a id="060007meades" class="box-images" href="notes/060007meades.htm">National school. Meade's yard. The hazard.</a> Only two there now. Nodding.
Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round
with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their
hats.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg81"></span>
<p>
A pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
tramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something
automatic 

<span id="ed1922pg88"></span>
so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow
would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job
making the new invention?

perhaps.
</p>
<p>
They went <a id="060023saintmarks" class="box-images" href="notes/060023saintmarks.htm">past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway
bridge, past the Queen's theatre</a>: in silence. Hoardings: <a id="060003eugenestratton1" class="box-images" href="notes/060003eugenestratton.htm">Eugene
Stratton</a>, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see <em>Leah</em> tonight, I wonder.
I said I. Or the <i>Lily of Killarney</i>? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big

drink or two. As broad as it's long.
</p>
<p>
He's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.
</p>
<p>
Plasto's. <a id="060022sirphilip" class="box-images" href="notes/060022sirphilip.htm">Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust.</a> Who was he?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in
salute.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Who? Mr Dedalus asked.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.
</p>
<p>
Just that moment I was thinking.
</p>
<p>
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of <a id="060020redbank" class="box-images" href="notes/060020redbank.htm">the Red Bank</a> the
white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: passed.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?
Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes
feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I
am just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body
getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes
that? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh
falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.
Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks
behind.
</p>
<p>
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant
glance over their faces.
</p>
<p>
Mr Power asked:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg82"></span>
<span id="ed1986pg76"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good
idea, you see...
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Are you going yourself?
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg89"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the
county Clare on some private business. You see<span id="ed1961pg92"></span> the idea is to tour the
chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.
</p>
<p>
Have you good artists?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all
topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in
fact.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And <i>Madame</i>, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped
them. <a id="060026smithobrien" class="box-images" href="notes/060026smithobrien.htm">Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman.
Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by
Farrell's statue</a> united noiselessly their unresisting knees.
</p>
<p>
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his
mouth opening: oot.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Four bootlaces for a penny.
</p>
<p>
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.
Same house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.
Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too.
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.
O'Callaghan on his last legs.
</p>
<p>
And <i>Madame</i>. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing
her hair, humming: <i>voglio e non vorrei</i>. No: <i>vorrei e non</i>. Looking at
the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. <i>Mi trema un poco
il</i>. Beautiful on that <i>tre</i> her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A
throstle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.
</p>
<p>
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over
the ears. <i>Madame</i>: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way.
Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the
woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it
told me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played
out pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her
a pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the
Moira, was it?
</p>
<p>
They passed under <a id="060012liberatorsform" class="box-images" href="notes/060012liberatorsform.htm">the hugecloaked Liberator's form</a>.
</p>
<p>
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg83"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.
</p>
<p>
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round<span id="ed1961pg93"></span> the corner
of <a id="060009elveryselephant" class="box-images" href="notes/060009elveryselephant.htm">Elvery's Elephant house</a>, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg90"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.
</p>
<p>
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The devil break the hasp of your back!
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg77"></span>
<p>
Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the
carriage passed <a id="060008sirjohngray" class="box-images" href="notes/060008sirjohngray.htm">Gray's statue</a>.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.
</p>
<p>
His eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Well, nearly all of us.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and
the son.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;About the boatman? Mr Power asked.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes. Isn't it awfully good?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to
send him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were both
...
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried
to drown...
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!
</p>
<p>
Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself...
</p>
<p>
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got
loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished
him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is...
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg94"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
saving his son's life.
</p>
<p>
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg84"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg91"></span>
<p>
Mr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.
</p>
<p>
<a id="070006nelsonspillar2" class="box-images" href="notes/070006nelsonspillar.htm">Nelson's pillar</a>.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.
</p>
<p>
Mr Dedalus sighed.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh.
Many a good one he told himself.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and
he<span id="ed1986pg78"></span> was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this. He's
gone from us.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went
very suddenly.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.
</p>
<p>
He tapped his chest sadly.
</p>
<p>
Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose.
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent
colouring it.
</p>
<p>
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The best death, Mr Bloom said.
</p>
<p>
Their wide open eyes looked at him.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.
</p>
<p>
No-one spoke.

<p>
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the <a id="060011therotunda" class="box-images" href="notes/060011therotunda.htm">Rotunda</a> corner,
galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry<span id="ed1961pg95"></span> to bury. A mourning
coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for
a nun.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.
</p>
<p>
A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's body,
weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society

nothing. Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If not
from the man. Better luck next time.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg92"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.
</p>
<p>
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his
bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own
life.
</p>
<p>
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We
must take a charitable view of it.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's
large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.
Like Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They<span id="ed1986pg79"></span> have no mercy
on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive
a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't broken
already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed
clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife
of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the
furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the
damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start
afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight
that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and
capering with Martin's umbrella.
</p>
<p class="dialog-lyrics" style="text-indent:0cm">&#8212;&nbsp;<i>And they call me the jewel of Asia, <br />
     Of Asia,  <br />
     The geisha.</i>
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg96"></span>
<p>
He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.
</p>
<p>
That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The
room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through
the slats of the Venetian blinds. The coroner's ears, big and
hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like
yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.
Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son
Leopold.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg86"></span>
<p>
No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.
</p>
<p>
The carriage rattled swiftly along <a id="060002berkeleystreet2" class="box-images" href="notes/060002berkeleystreet.htm">Blessington street</a>. Over the stones.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg93"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow
in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.
</p>
<p>
As they turned into <a id="060002berkeleystreet" class="box-images" href="notes/060002berkeleystreet.htm">Berkeley street</a> a streetorgan near the Basin sent
over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody
here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from <i>Saul.</i> He's
as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! <a id="010068themater2" class="box-images-med" href="notes/010068themater.htm">The <i>Mater
Misericordiae</i>. Eccles street. My house down there.</a> Big place. Ward for
incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the dying.
Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look
terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the
spoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student
that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the
lying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other. The
carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What's wrong now?
</p>
<p>
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching
by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony
croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating<span id="ed1986pg80"></span> their
fear.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Emigrants, Mr Power said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.
</p>
<p>
Huuuh! out of that!
</p>
<p>
Thursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them
about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for old
England. They buy up all the<span id="ed1961pg97"></span> juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter is
lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a
year. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,
soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off
the train at Clonsilla.
</p>
<p>
The carriage moved on through the drove.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the
parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken
in trucks down to the boats.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg87"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite
right. They ought to.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have 

<span id="ed1922pg94"></span>
<!-- topofpage -->
municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line
out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage
and all. Don't you see what I mean?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon
diningroom.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more decent
than galloping two abreast?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when
the hearse capsized <a id="060014dunphyscorner" class="box-images" href="notes/060014dunphyscorner.htm">round Dunphy's</a> and upset the coffin on to the road.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell
about the road. Terrible!
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.
</p>
<p>
Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam
shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large
for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up now.
Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose
quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax.
The sphincter loose. Seal up all.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.
</p>
<p>
Dunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A
pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up
here on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.
Elixir of life.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg98"></span>
<p>
But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him
in the knocking about? He would and he wouldn't, I suppose. Depends on<span id="ed1986pg81"></span>
where. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It
would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.
</p>
<p>
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted
by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.
</p>
<p>
<a id="060016crossgunsbridge" class="box-images" href="notes/060016crossgunsbridge.htm">Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.</a>
</p>
<p>
Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his
dropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a<span id="ed1932pg88"></span>
slacktethered horse. Aboard of the <i>Bugabu.</i>
</p>
<p>
Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his
raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, 

<span id="ed1922pg95"></span>

over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,
Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or
cycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at
the auction but a lady's. Developing waterways. James M'Cann's hobby
to row me o'er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats.
Camping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without
writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. <a id="060016crossgunsbridge2" class="box-images" href="notes/060016crossgunsbridge.htm">Dropping down lock by
lock to Dublin.</a> With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his
brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.
</p>
<p>
They drove on past <a id="060017brianboroimhehouse" class="box-images-short" href="notes/060017brianboroimhehouse.htm">Brian Boroimhe house</a>. Near it now.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.
</p>
<p>
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.
</p>
<p>
The stonecutter's yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of
land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,
knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:
appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and
sculptor.
</p>
<p>
Passed.
</p>
<p>
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat,
grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown
yawning boot. After life's journey.
</p>
<p>
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg99"></span>
<p>
Mr Power pointed.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.
Murdered his brother. Or so they said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham said. That's the maxim of the
law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person
to be wrongfully condemned.
</p>
<p>
They looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless,
unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder.
The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered.<span id="ed1986pg82"></span> They love reading about
it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing<span id="ed1932pg89"></span> consisted of. How she met
her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large.
Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg96"></span>
<p>
Cramped in this carriage. She mightn't like me to come that way without
letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with
their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.
</p>
<p>
<a id="060024thegates" class="box-images" href="notes/060024thegates.htm">The high railings of Prospect</a> rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,
rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the
trees, white forms and fragments streaming by <a id="010070mutes4" class="box-images" href="notes/010070mutes.htm">mutely, sustaining vain
gestures</a> on the air.
</p>
<p>
The <a id="060024thegates3" class="box-images" href="notes/060024thegates.htm">felly</a> harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put
out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with
his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.
</p>
<p>
Change that soap now. Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand
still held.
</p>
<p>
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It's all the same.
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and
fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.
Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.
</p>
<p>
He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by<span id="ed1961pg100"></span> the opened hearse and took
out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.
</p>
<p>
Where is that child's funeral disappeared to?
</p>
<p>
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,
dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a
granite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.
</p>
<p>
Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it
with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing
on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here
every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount
Jerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every
minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands
every hour. Too many in the world.
</p>
<p>
Mourners came out through <a id="060024thegates2" class="box-images" href="notes/060024thegates.htm">the gates</a>: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,
hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with dirt
and tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.
Fish's face, bloodless and livid.
</p>

<p>
<a id="010070mutes3" class="box-images" href="notes/010070mutes.htm">The mutes</a> shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So much

dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First
the<span id="ed1986pg83"></span> stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the
boy followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the
brother-in-law.
</p>
<p>
All walked after.
</p>
<p>
Martin Cunningham whispered:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What? Mr Power whispered. How so?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the
Queen's hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.
Anniversary.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?
</p>
<p>
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
towards <a id="060015cardinalsmausoleum" class="box-images" href="notes/060015cardinalsmausoleum.htm">the cardinal's mausoleum</a>. Speaking.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily
mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;How many children did he leave?
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg101"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.
</p>
<p>
Has the laugh at him now.
</p>
<p>
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had
outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must
outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the
world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow
him. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who
knows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. <a id="060028frogmore" class="box-images" href="notes/060028frogmore.htm">Drawn on
a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning.</a> But
in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of
hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the
substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,
waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and
lie no more in her warm bed.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven't
seen you for a month of Sundays.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg98"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert
said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg91"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And how is Dick, the solid man?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<a id="010098metbutterly4" class="box-images" href="notes/010098metbutterly.htm">Nothing between himself and heaven</a>, Ned Lambert answered.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the
insurance is cleared up.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg84"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton is
behind. He put down his name for a quid.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought
to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg102"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
They halted about the door of the <a id="060001mortuarychapel" class="box-images" href="notes/060001mortuarychapel.htm">mortuary chapel</a>. Mr Bloom stood behind
the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the
slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there
when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment
and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three
shillings to O'Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin
into the chapel. Which end is his head?
</p>
<p>
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
light. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a
wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners
knelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the
font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black
hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.
</p>
<p>
<a id="010084server2" class="box-images" href="notes/010084server.htm">A server</a> bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one
hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's belly.
<a id="060006toadeyes2" class="box-images" href="notes/060006toadeyes.htm">Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.</a>
</p>
<p>
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book
with a fluent croak.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg99"></span>
<p>
Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. <i>Domine-namine.</i> Bully
about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe
betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst
sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly<span id="ed1932pg92"></span> on
him like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn:

What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of

beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Brown. Down in the vaults of
saint Werburgh's lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a
hole in the coffins<span id="ed1986pg85"></span> sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it
rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you're a goner.
</p>
<p>
My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.
</p>
<p>
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's
bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and
shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you
were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.
</p>
<p>
<i>&#8212;&nbsp;Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.</i>
</p>
<p>
The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be
better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course
...
</p>
<p>
Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed
up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal
day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in
childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls
with little sparrows' breasts. All the year round he prayed the same
thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam
now.
</p>
<p>
<i>&#8212;&nbsp;In paradisum.</i>
</p>
<p>
Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over
everybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.
</p>
<p>
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny

Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher
gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed
them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last
folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground
till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels<span id="ed1932pg93"></span> ground the
gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the barrow along a lane of sepulchres.
</p>
<p>
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn't lilt here.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.
</p>
<p>
Mr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of <a id="060027loftycone" class="box-images" href="notes/060027loftycone.htm">the lofty cone</a>.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg104"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. <a id="020038oconnell3" class="box-images" href="notes/020038oconnell.htm">But
his heart is buried in Rome.</a> How many broken hearts are buried here,
Simon!
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I'll soon be stretched
beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.
</p>
<p>
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;She's better where she is, he said kindly.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in
heaven if there is a heaven.
</p>
<p>
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
plod by.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg86"></span>
<p>
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can
do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.
</p>
<p>
They covered their heads.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think?
Mr Kernan said with reproof.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret
eyes, secretsearching eyes. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We
are the last. In the same boat. Hope he'll say something else.
</p>
<p>
Mr Kernan added:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more
impressive I must say.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.
</p>
<p>
Mr Kernan said with solemnity:
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg101"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<i>I am the resurrection and the life</i>. That touches a man's inmost
heart.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;It does, Mr Bloom said.
</p>
<p>
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two
with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.
Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood
every day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of
them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn
the thing else.<span id="ed1932pg94"></span> The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are
dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. <a id="010098metbutterly3" class="box-images" href="notes/010098metbutterly.htm">Come
forth, Lazarus!</a> And he came fifth and lost the job. Get<span id="ed1961pg105"></span> up! Last day!
Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the
rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of
powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.
</p>
<p>
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Everything went off A1, he said. What?
</p>
<p>
He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman's shoulders. With
your tooraloom tooraloom.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;As it should be, Mr Kernan said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.
</p>
<p>
Mr Kernan assured him.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I
know his face.
</p>
<p>
Ned Lambert glanced back.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Bloom, he said, Madam Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the
soprano. She's his wife.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven't seen her for some
time. She was a finelooking woman. <a id="170008precedingseries31" class="box-images" href="notes/170008precedingseries.htm">I danced with her, wait, fifteen
seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. And a good
armful she was.</a>
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg87"></span>
<p>
He looked behind through the others.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery
line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.
</p>
<p>
Ned Lambert smiled.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for blottingpaper.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like
that for? She had plenty of game in her then.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.
</p>
<p>
John Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg102"></span>
<p>
The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.
</p>
<p>
Mr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I am come to pay you another visit.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg106"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don't want
your custom at all.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg95"></span>
<p>
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
Cunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from <a id="050014thecoombe2" class="box-images" href="notes/050014thecoombe.htm">the Coombe</a>?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I did not, Martin Cunningham said.
</p>
<p>
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for
Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After
traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the
drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking
up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.
</p>
<p>
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He
resumed:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, <i>Not a bloody bit like
the man</i>, says he. <a id="010098metbutterly2" class="box-images" href="notes/010098metbutterly.htm"><i>That's not Mulcahy</i></a>, says he, <i>whoever done it</i>.
</p>
<p>
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting
the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I know, Hynes said. I know that.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It's pure
goodheartedness: damn the thing else.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. All want to be on good
terms with him. Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort. Keys:
like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks.
<i>Habeas corpus</i>. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I
write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me
writing to Martha?<span id="ed1986pg88"></span> Hope it's not chucked

in the dead letter office. Be
the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That's the first sign when
the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among
the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder<span id="ed1961pg107"></span> how he had the gumption to propose to
any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her. It
might thrill her first. Courting death... Shades of night hovering
here with all the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when
churchyards yawn and <a id="020038oconnell2" class="box-images" href="notes/020038oconnell.htm">Daniel O'Connell must be a descendant I suppose
who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man</a><span id="ed1932pg96"></span> great catholic all the
same like a big giant in the dark. <a id="150004willowisp2" class="box-images" href="notes/150004willowisp.htm">Will o' the wisp.</a> Gas of graves.
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all. Women especially are so
touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever
seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a pitchdark night. The clock was on
the stroke of twelve. Still they'd kiss all right if properly keyed up.
Whores in Turkish graveyards. Learn anything if taken young. You might
pick up a young widow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones.
Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both
ends meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to
the starving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting
to do it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.
</p>
<p>
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field
after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing.
Sitting or kneeling you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some
day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed
the ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim
grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well,
so it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant
poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic
Gardens are just over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives
new life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every
man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable
for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor
and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. With
thanks.
</p>
<p>
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot
quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy
kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, treacle oozing out of
them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they
are go on<span id="ed1961pg108"></span> living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to
feed on feed on themselves.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg104"></span>
<p>
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply
swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little
seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of
power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life.
Cracking his jokes too: warms the <a id="030080cockles2" class="box-images" href="notes/030080cockles.htm">cockles</a> of his heart. The one about
the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11 p.m.
(closing time). Not<span id="ed1986pg89"></span> arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men<span id="ed1932pg97"></span>
anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in
fashion. A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep
out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.
Gravediggers in <i>Hamlet</i>. Shows the profound knowledge of the human
heart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. <i>De mortuis
nil nisi prius</i>. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral.
Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live
longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;How many have-you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.
</p>
<p>
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to
trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping
with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its
nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.
</p>
<p>
Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June. He
doesn't know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot
over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd
give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never
dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he
could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though he
could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First
thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to
life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you
come to look at it.
</p>
<p class="lyrics"> <i>O, poor Robinson Crusoe! <br />
     How could you possibly do so?</i>
</p>
<p>
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of
them all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed<span id="ed1961pg109"></span> through. They could
invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way. Ay but 

<span id="ed1922pg105"></span>

they might object to be buried out of another fellow's.
They're so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from
the holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one
coffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible
even in the earth. The Irishman's house is his coffin. Embalming in
catacombs, mummies the same idea.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.
Twelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death's
number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the chapel, that
I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg98"></span>
<p>
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had
one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was
once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit
of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It's dyed. His wife I forgot he's not
married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg90"></span>
<p>
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the
gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.
</p>
<p>
Pause.
</p>
<p>
<a id="030087pastlife5" class="box-images" href="notes/030087pastlife.htm">If we were all suddenly somebody else.</a>
</p>
<p>
Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they
say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.
</p>
<p>
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The
boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in
the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.
Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.
Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment you feel. Must be
damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone
else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven't yet. Then
darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you
like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid
all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his
lower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the
soles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the
floor since he's doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner's<span id="ed1961pg110"></span> death showing
him a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of <i>Lucia.
Shall i nevermore behold thee</i>? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People
talk about you a bit: forget you. Don't forget to pray for him. Remember
him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow:
dropping into a hole, one after the other.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg106"></span>
<p>
We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well and
not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the
fire of purgatory.
</p>
<p>
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when
you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning. Near
you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor
mamma, and little Rudy.
</p>
<p>
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in
on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned his face. And if he was alive all
the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of<span id="ed1932pg99"></span>
course. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have
some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or
a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of
distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well
to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there's no.
</p>
<p>
The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.
</p>
<p>
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of
it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves
without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its
way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he
traversed the dismal fields.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg91"></span>
<p>
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he
knows them all. No: coming to me.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your
christian name? I'm not sure.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too. He
asked me to.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the <i>Freeman</i> once.
</p>
<p>
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good
idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know.
He died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads.
Charley, you're my darling.<span id="ed1961pg111"></span> That was why he asked me to. O well, does
no harm. I saw to that, M'Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him
under an obligation: costs nothing.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was
over there in the...
</p>
<p>
He looked around.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg107"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don't know who he is. Is that his
name?
</p>
<p>
He moved away, looking about him.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!
</p>
<p>
Didn't hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all
the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good
Lord, what became of him?
</p>
<p>
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;O, excuse me!
</p>
<p>
He stepped aside nimbly.
</p>
<p>
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers<span id="ed1932pg100"></span> rested their
spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped
his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The
gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards
the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent
to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates,
walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.
The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.
Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For
yourselves just.
</p>
<p>
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying awhile to read a name on a tomb.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. We have time.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Let us, Mr Power said.
</p>
<p>
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr
Power's blank voice spoke:
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg92"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled
with stones. That one day he will come again.
</p>
<p>
Hynes shook his head.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg112"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Parnell will never come again, he said. He's there, all that was
mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,
broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,
old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some
charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody
really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then
lump them together<span id="ed1922pg108"></span>
to save time. All souls' day. Twentyseventh I'll be
at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds.
Old man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death's
door. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of
their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the
bucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So,
wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the
pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew.
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it
Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it.
Old Dr Murren's. The great physician called him home. Well it's God's
acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted.
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the <i>Church Times.</i> Marriage
ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths<span id="ed1932pg101"></span> hung on knobs, garlands of
bronzefoil. Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more
poetical. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses
nothing. Immortelles.

A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the
wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hu! Not a budge out of him.
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder.
Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a
daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.
</p>
<p>
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be
sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was
dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this
infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket
of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the
boy. Apollo that was.
</p>
<p>
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed. As
you are now so once were we.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg113"></span>
<p>
Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the
voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in
the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain
hellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph
reminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face<span id="ed1986pg93"></span> after
fifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that died
when I was in Wisdom Hely's.
</p>
<p>
Rtststr! <a id="030038pebbles3" class="box-images" href="notes/030038pebbles.htm">A rattle of pebbles.</a> Wait. Stop!

<p>
He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he
goes.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg109"></span>
<p>
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the
pebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey
alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.
Good hidingplace for treasure.
</p>
<p>
Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was
buried here by torchlight, wasn't he? Making his rounds.
</p>
<p>
Tail gone now.
</p>
<p>
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones
clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat
gone bad. Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that
<i>Voyages in China</i> that the Chinese say a white man smells like a
corpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the
other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the
plague.<span id="ed1932pg102"></span> Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to ashes.
Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds.
Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole
life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can't bury in the
air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news go about
whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication. We learned
that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular square feed for them.
Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn't care
about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste
like raw white turnips.
</p>
<p>
The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.
Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I
was here was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills.
And even scraping up the earth at<span id="ed1961pg114"></span> night with a lantern like that case
I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running
gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after
death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after
death. There is another world after death named hell. <a id="050003otherworld4" class="box-images" href="notes/050003otherworld.htm">I do not like that
other world she wrote.</a> No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel
yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty
beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm
fullblooded life.

Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.
</p>
<p>
Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,
commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.
Mat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars,
the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out
that evening on 

<span id="ed1922pg110"></span>

the bowling green because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke
of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate
at first sight.<span id="ed1986pg94"></span> <a id="170008precedingseries30" class="box-images" href="notes/170008precedingseries.htm">Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree,
laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.</a>
</p>
<p>
Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.
</p>
<p>
They stopped.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.
</p>
<p>
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. John Henry Menton took
off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his
coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said.
</p>
<span id="ed1932pg103"></span>
<p>
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Thank you, he said shortly.
</p>
<p>
They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind
a few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin
could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his
seeing it.
</p>
<p>
Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.
Get the pull over him that way.
</p>
<p>
Thank you. How grand we are this morning!
