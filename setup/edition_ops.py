		'''Gabler pagination reproduces the pages of Random House's 1986 edition, also printed in Vintage paperbacks,

			The Gabler Ulysses, touted at its release as "the corrected text" but eviscerated soon afterward by John Kidd, 
			is still seen by many professional Joyceans, despite the controversy, as by far the best available version. 
			I take a skeptical approach to this canonical text, questioning both the literary merits of particular editorial 
			choices and the underlying methodology of privileging early textual variants over ones ratified later in the 
			publication history.  When in doubt, I prefer to err on the side of trusting the process by which the errata-riddled 
			text of 1922 was slowly improved in printings that Joyce authorized. Many of my notes comment on Gabler's 
			changesâ€”sometimes affirmatively,  sometimes critically, and sometimes simply to ask how adopting them might affect 
			the reading of a passage.'''
