&#8212;&nbsp;<a id="020001cochrane" class="box-images" href="notes/020001cochrane.htm">You, Cochrane</a>, <a id="020002pyrrhus" class="box-images" href="notes/020002pyrrhus.htm">what city sent for him?</a>
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Tarentum, sir.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Very good. Well?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;There was a battle, sir.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Very good. Where?
</p>
<p>
The boy's blank face asked the blank window.
</p>
<p>
&#09;<a id="020003daughtersofmemory1" class="box-images" href="notes/020003daughtersofmemory.htm">Fabled by the daughters of memory.</a> And yet it was in some way if not as
memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, <a id="020003daughtersofmemory2" class="box-images" href="notes/020003daughtersofmemory.htm">thud of Blake's wings
of excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
masonry, and time one livid final flame.</a> What's left us then?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the
gorescarred book.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, sir. And he said: <i>Another victory like that and we are done
for.</i>
</p>
<p>
That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From
a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;End of Pyrrhus, sir?
</p>
</a><span id="ed1932pg22"> </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?
</p>
<p>
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. He curled them
between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to
the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff people, proud
that their eldest son was <a id="010058bloodyswindle5" class="box-images" href="notes/010058bloodyswindle.htm">in the navy</a>. <a id="020004vicoroad1" class="box-images" href="notes/020004vicoroad.htm">Vico road, Dalkey</a>.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.
</p>
<p>
All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round 

<span id="ed1922pg24"></span>
at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh
more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,
what is a pier.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a
bridge. <a id="020005kingstownpier1" class="box-images" href="notes/020005kingstownpier.htm">Kingstown pier</a>, sir.
</p>
<p>
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench
whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned <span id="ed1961pg24"></span>nor ever been <span id="ed1986pg20"> </span>innocent.
All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their
likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets
tittering in the struggle.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.
</p>
<p>
The words troubled their gaze.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.
</p>
<p>
For <a id="020006chapbook1" class="box-images" href="notes/020006chapbook.htm">Haines's chapbook</a>. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild
drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A
jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a
clement master's praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly
for the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other
too often heard, their land a pawnshop.
</p>
<p>
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam's hand in Argos <a id="020007juliuscaesar1" class="box-images" href="notes/020007juliuscaesar.htm">or Julius Caesar not
been knifed to death</a>. They are not to be thought away. Time has
branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of <a id="020008infinitepossibilities1" class="box-images" href="notes/020008infinitepossibilities.htm">the infinite
possibilities they have ousted</a>. But can those have been possible seeing
that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass?
Weave, <a id="010120weavewind2" class="box-images" href="notes/010120weavewind.htm">weaver of the wind</a>.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Tell us a story, sir.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;O, do, sir. A <a id="020009ghoststory1" class="box-images" href="notes/020009ghoststory.htm">ghoststory</a>.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<i>Weep no more,</i> Comyn said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Go on then, Talbot.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;And the history, sir?
</p>
</a><span id="ed1932pg23"></span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.
</p>
<p>
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg25"></span>
<p class="dialog-lyrics"><i>&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more <br />
     For <a id="020010lycidas1" class="box-images" href="notes/020010lycidas.htm">Lycidas</a>, your sorrow, is not dead, <br />
     Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor...<a id="020007juliuscaesar1" class="box-images" href="notes/020007juliuscaesar.htm"></a></i>
</p>
<p>
It must be <a id="020008infinitepossibilities2" class="box-images" href="notes/020008infinitepossibilities.htm">a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.</a>
Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated
out into the studious silence of <a id="020011saintgenevieve1" class="box-images" href="notes/020011saintgenevieve.htm">the library of Saint Genevieve</a> where he
had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow
a delicate <a id="020012siamese1" class="box-images" href="notes/020012siamese.htm">Siamese conned a handbook of strategy</a>. Fed and feeding brains
about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: <span id="ed1961pg25"></span>and

thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the
soul is the form of forms.</a> Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of
forms.
</p>
<p>
Talbot repeated:
</p>
<p class="dialog-lyrics"><i>&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, <br />
     Through the dear might...</i>
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg21"> </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don't see anything.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.
</p>
<p>
His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having
just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these
craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer's heart and lips and
on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him <a id="020014coinoftribute1" class="box-images" href="notes/020014coinoftribute.htm">a coin of the
tribute. To Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's.</a> A long
look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and <a id="010120weavewind3" class="box-images" href="notes/010120weavewind.htm">woven on the
church's looms</a>. Ay.
</p>
<p class="lyrics"><i><a id="020015riddleme1" class="box-images" href="notes/020015riddleme.htm">Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro. <br />
     My father gave me seeds to sow.</a></i>
</p>
<p>
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Have I heard all? Stephen asked.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, sir. <a id="020016hockey1" class="box-images" href="notes/020016hockey.htm">Hockey</a> at ten, sir.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Half day, sir. Thursday.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.
</p>
<p>
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.
</a><span id="ed1932pg24"></span>Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling
gaily:
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg26"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;O, ask me, sir.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A hard one, sir.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;This is the riddle, Stephen said:
</p>
<p class="lyrics"><i>The cock crew, <br />
     The sky was blue: <br />
     The bells in heaven <br />
     Were striking eleven. <br />
     'Tis time for this poor soul <br />
     To go to heaven.</i>
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg26"></span><p>
What is that?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What, sir?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Again, sir. We didn't hear.
</p>
<p>
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence
Cochrane said:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What is it, sir? We give it up.
</p>
<p>
Stephen, his throat itching, answered:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<a id="020009ghoststory3" class="box-images" href="notes/020009ghoststory.htm">The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.</a>
</p>
<p>
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
echoed dismay.
</p>
<p>
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Hockey!
</p>
<p>
They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly
they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
clamour of their boots and tongues.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg22"> </span><p>
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
copybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his
cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
and damp as a snail's bed.
</p>
<p>
He held out his copybook. The word <i>Sums</i> was written on the headline.
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<a id="020017deasy1" class="box-images" href="notes/020017deasy.htm">Mr Deasy</a> told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them
to you, sir.
</p>
<p>
Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg27"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.
</p>
</a><span id="ed1932pg25"></span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to
copy them off the board, sir.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;No, sir.
</p>
<p>
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail's
bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.
But for her the race of the world would have <a id="020053squashedsnail1" class="box-images" href="notes/020053squashedsnail.htm">trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail</a>. She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own. <a id="020019onlytruething1" class="box-images" href="notes/020019onlytruething.htm">Was that then real? The only true thing in life?</a> His
mother's prostrate body <a id="020018columbanus1" class="box-images" href="notes/020018columbanus.htm">the fiery Columbanus</a> in holy zeal bestrode.
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire,
an odour of <a id="010045waxandrosewood3" class="box-images" href="notes/010045waxandrosewood.htm">rosewood and wetted ashes</a>. She <span id="ed1961pg27"></span>had saved him from being
trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul
gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek
of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth,
listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.
</p>
<p>
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. <a id="010139hearhim2" class="box-images" href="notes/010139hearhim.htm">He proves by algebra
that Shakespeare's ghost is Hamlet's grandfather.</a> Sargent peered askance
through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the
hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.
</p>
<p>
Across the page <a id="020020morrice1" class="box-images" href="notes/020020morrice.htm">the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.</a> Give hands,

the world, <a id="020021averromonides1" class="box-images" href="notes/020021averromonides.htm">Averroes and Moses Maimonides</a>, dark men in mien and movement,
flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure <a id="020022animamundi1" class="box-images" href="notes/020022animamundi.htm">soul of the world</a>, a
<a id="020023darkness1" class="box-images" href="notes/020023darkness.htm">darkness shining in brightness</a> which brightness could not comprehend.</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word
of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of
shame flickering behind his dull skin. <a id="020024amormatris1" class="box-images" href="notes/020024amormatris.htm"><i>Amor matris:</i> subjective and
objective genitive.</a> With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed
him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg23"> </span><p>
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My
childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or
lightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony
sit in the <a id="020023darkness2" class="box-images" href="notes/020023darkness.htm">dark palaces of both
  <span id="ed1922pg28"></span>our hearts</a>: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.
</p>
<p>
The sum was done.
</p>
</a><span id="ed1932pg26"></span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.
</p>
<p>
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
copybook back to his desk.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said
as he followed towards the door the boy's graceless form.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, sir.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg28"></span><p>
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Sargent!
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Run on, Stephen said. <a id="020017deasy" class="box-images" href="notes/020017deasy.htm">Mr Deasy</a> is calling you.
</p>
<p>
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and
Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When
he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He
turned his angry white moustache.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What is it now? he cried continually without listening.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Will you wait in <a id="020075samewisdom2" class="box-images" href="notes/020075samewisdom.htm">my study</a> for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore
order here.
</p>
<p>
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man's voice
cried sternly:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What is the matter? What is it now?
</p>
<p>
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed
round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.
</p>
<p>
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather
of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. <p><a id="020025asitwas1" class="box-images" href="notes/020025asitwas.htm">As it was
in the beginning,</a> is now. On the <a id="020027sideboard1" class="box-images" href="notes/020027sideboard.htm">sideboard</a> the tray of <a id="020026stuartcoins1" class="box-images" href="notes/020026stuartcoins.htm">Stuart coins</a>,

gentiles</a>: world without end. </p>
<p>
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his
rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;First, our little financial settlement, he said.
</p>
<p>
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It
slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and
laid them carefully on the table.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg29"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg24"> </span><p>
And now his <a id="020075samewisdom4" class="box-images" href="notes/020075samewisdom.htm">strongroom</a> for the gold. Stephen's embarrassed hand moved
over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: </a>whelks and <span id="ed1932pg27"></span>money
cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir's turban, and
this, <a id="020030shellmoney" class="box-images" href="notes/020030shellmoney.htm">the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim's hoard</a>, dead treasure, hollow shells.</p>
<p>
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.
</p>
<span id="ed1961pg29"></span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his <a id="020029savingsbox1" class="box-images" href="notes/020029savingsbox.htm">little savingsbox</a> about in his hand. These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is for
shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.
</p>
<p>
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<a id="010019money28" class="box-images" href="notes/010019money.htm">Three twelve</a>, he said. I think you'll find that's right.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.
</p>
<p>
Stephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too
of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and
misery.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Don't carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You'll pull it out somewhere
and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You'll find them very
handy.
</p>
<p>
Answer something.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.
</p>
<p>
The same room and hour, the <a id="020075samewisdom" class="box-images" href="notes/020075samewisdom.htm">same wisdom</a>: and I the same. <a id="020025asitwas2" class="box-images" href="notes/020025asitwas.htm">Three times
now. Three nooses round me here.</a> Well? I can break them in this instant
if I will.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Because <a id="020031youdontsave1" class="box-images" href="notes/020031youdontsave.htm">you don't save</a>, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don't
know yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as I
have. I know, I know. <a id="020032moneypurse1" class="box-images" href="notes/020032moneypurse.htm">If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say? <i>Put but money in thy purse.</i></a> </p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Iago, Stephen murmured.
</p>
<p>
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. <a id="020033mademoney1" class="box-images" href="notes/020033mademoney.htm">He made money.</a> A poet, yes, but
an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you
know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman's
mouth?

<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets. 
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg30"></span>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That's not English. <a id="020034frenchcelt1" class="box-images-med" href="notes/020034frenchcelt.htm">A French Celt said that.</a> He
tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail. </p>

<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;For the moment, no, Stephen answered.
</p>
<p>
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I knew you couldn't, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it.
We are a generous people but we must also be just.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I fear <a id="030037griffith2" class="box-images" href="notes/030037griffith.htm">those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy</a>.
</p>
<p>
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at <a id="020036fillibegs1" class="box-images" href="notes/020036fillibegs.htm">the

<p>
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But
I am descended from <a id="020047johnblackwood1" class="box-images" href="notes/020047johnblackwood.htm">sir John Blackwood who voted for the union</a>. We are
all Irish, all kings' sons.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Alas, Stephen said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<a id="020047johnblackwood2" class="box-images" href="notes/020047johnblackwood.htm"><i>Per vias rectas</i>, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.</a>

</p>
</a><span id="ed1932pg29"></span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, <span id="ed1961pg31"></span>Mr Dedalus,
with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.
Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.
</p>
<p>
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read
off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, <i>the dictates of
common sense.</i> Just a moment.
</p>
<p>
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow
and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.
</p>
<p>
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed
around the walls <a id="020050vanishedhorses1" class="box-images" href="notes/020050vanishedhorses.htm">images of vanished horses</a> stood in homage, their <span id="ed1986pg26"> </span>meek

riders sat them</a>,  watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds, backing king's
colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of this
allimportant question...
</p>
<p>
<a id="020051evenmoney2" class="box-images" href="notes/020051evenmoney.htm">Where Cranly led me to get rich quick</a>, hunting his winners among the
mudsplashed brakes, amid bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek
of the canteen, over the motley slush. Even
money Fair Rebel: ten to one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers
we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past
the meatfaced woman, a butcher's dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of
orange. </p>
<p>
Shouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle.
</p>
<p>
Again: a goal. I am among them, among their <a id="020052battlingbodies1" class="box-images" href="notes/020052battlingbodies.htm">battling bodies</a> in a medley,
the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother's darling who seems
to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain,
a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.
</p>
<p>
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I have put the matter into <a id="020056nutshell1" class="box-images" href="notes/020056nutshell.htm">a nutshell</a>, Mr Deasy said. It's about
the <a id="020054footandmouth1" class="box-images" href="notes/020054footandmouth.htm">foot and mouth disease</a>. Just look through it. There can be no two
opinions on the matter.

He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. <a id="020060jewmerchants3" class="box-images" href="notes/020060jewmerchants.htm">England is in the hands of the
jews.</a> In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are
the signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the
nation's vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure
as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of
destruction. Old England is dying.
</p>
<p>
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Dying, he said, if not dead by now.
</p>
<p class="lyrics"><a id="020059oldengland1" class="box-images" href="notes/020059oldengland.htm"><i>The harlot's cry from street to street <br />

</p>
<p>
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which
he halted.
</p>

<span id="ed1922pg33"></span>
<span id="ed1961pg33"></span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or
gentile, is he not?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<a id="020060jewmerchants1" class="box-images" href="notes/020060jewmerchants.htm">They sinned against the light</a>, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see
<a id="020023darkness4" class="box-images" href="notes/020023darkness.htm">the darkness in their eyes</a>. And that is why they are <a id="020061wanderers1" class="box-images" href="notes/020061wanderers.htm">wanderers on the earth to this day.</a>

prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,
uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk
</a><span id="ed1932pg31"></span>hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full
slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but
knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain
patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard
heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their
years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Who has not? Stephen said.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.
</p>
<p>
He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell
sideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;History, Stephen said, is <a id="020063nightmare1" class="box-images" href="notes/020063nightmare.htm">a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.</a>
</p>
<p>
From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. <a id="020067onegreatgoal1" class="box-images" href="notes/020067onegreatgoal.htm">All human
history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.</a>
</p>
<p>
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That is God.
</p>
<p>
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;What? Mr Deasy asked.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;<a id="020069streetshout1" class="box-images" href="notes/020069streetshout.htm">A shout in the street</a>, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.
</p>
<span id="ed1986pg28"> </span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and
many sins. <a id="020070womansin1" class="box-images" href="notes/020070womansin.htm">A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no

</p>
<p>
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Well, sir, he began...
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long
at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am
wrong.
</p>
</a><span id="ed1932pg32"></span><p>
&#8212;&nbsp;A learner rather, Stephen said.
</p>
<p>
And here what will you learn more?
</p>
<p>
Mr Deasy shook his head.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great
teacher.
</p>
<p>
Stephen rustled the sheets again.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;As regards these, he began.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them
published at once.
</p>
<p>
<i>Telegraph. <a id="020077homestead1" class="box-images" href="notes/020077homestead.htm">Irish Homestead.</a></i></p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two
editors slightly.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,
M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at <a id="020066cityarms1" class="box-images" href="notes/020066cityarms.htm">the
City Arms hotel.</a> I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You
see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?

</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to
answer that letter from my cousin.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
Thank you.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I
like to break a lance with you, old as I am.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.
</p>
<p>
<a id="020072lionscouchant1" class="box-images" href="notes/020072lionscouchant.htm">He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees</a>,

&#8212;&nbsp;Mr Dedalus!
</p>
<p>
Running after me. No more letters, I hope.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Just one moment.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.
</p>
<p>
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of
being <a id="020068letthemin2" class="box-images" href="notes/020068letthemin.htm">the only country which never persecuted the jews.</a> Do you know
that? No. And do you know why?
</p>
<p>
He frowned sternly on the bright air.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.
</p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.</p>
</a><span id="ed1932pg33"></span><p>A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
  rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
  his lifted arms waving to the air. </p>
<p>
&#8212;&nbsp;She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That's why.
</p>
<p>
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
spangles, dancing coins.</p>
