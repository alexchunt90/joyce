<a id="170003parallelcourses1" class="box-images" href="notes/170003parallelcourses.htm">What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow</a> <a id="170007returning" class="box-images" href="notes/170007returning.htm">returning</a>?
</p>
<p>
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they
followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and
Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,
Gardiner's place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of
Temple street, north: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing
right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching,
disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both <a id="040008georgeschurch5" class="box-images" href="notes/040008georgeschurch.htm">the circus before
George's church</a> <a id="170003parallelcourses2" class="box-images" href="notes/170003parallelcourses.htm">diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than
the arc</a> which it subtends.
</p>
<p class="question">
Of what <a id="170004duumvirate" class="box-images" href="notes/170004duumvirate.htm">did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary</a>?
</p><span id="ed1932pg572"></span>
<p>
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,
prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and
glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, <a id="170005dustbuckets" class="box-images" href="notes/170005dustbuckets.htm">exposed
corporation emergency dustbuckets</a>, the Roman catholic church,
ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, <a id="010008jesuit4" class="box-images" href="notes/010008jesuit.htm">jesuit education</a>, careers,
the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the
presabbath, Stephen's collapse.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective
like and unlike reactions to experience?
</p>
<p>
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to
plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner
of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both
indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of
heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox
religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted
the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual
magnetism.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg619"></span>
<p class="question">
Were their views on some points divergent?
<p>
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's views on the importance of dietary
and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views
on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom
assented <span id="ed1986pg544"></span>covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism
involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to
christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,
son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the <span id="ed1961pg666"></span>reign of
Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (&dagger;
266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty
and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to
gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of
adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and
the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen
attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both
from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin) <a id="170001womanshand1" class="box-images" href="notes/170001womanshand.htm">at first
no bigger than a woman's hand</a>.
</p>
<p class="question">
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?
</p>
<p>
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining
paraheliotropic trees.
</p><span id="ed1932pg573"></span>
<p class="question">
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in
the past?
</p>
<p>
In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public
thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's
corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. 
In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall
between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony
of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and
prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class
railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian
Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on
the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once
in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour
of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.
</p>
<p class="question">
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,
1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at
their destination?
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg620"></span>
<p>
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction
of the converse domain of interindividual relations.
</p>
<p class="question">
As in what ways?
</p>
<p>
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as <span id="ed1961pg667"></span>one received:
existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence
to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.
</p><span id="ed1986pg545"></span>
<p class="question">
What action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?
</p>
<p>
At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, <a id="040005seveneccles5" class="box-images" href="notes/040005seveneccles.htm">number
7 Eccles street</a>, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket
of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.
</p>
<p class="question">
Was it there?
</p>
<p>
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on
the day but one preceding.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why was he doubly irritated?
</p>
<p>
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded
himself twice not to forget.
</p><span id="ed1932pg574"></span>
<p class="question">
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly
(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?
</p>
<p>
To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.
</p>
<p class="question">
Bloom's decision?
</p>
<p>
A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the
area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches
of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by
separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for
the impact of the fall.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did he fall?
</p>
<p>
By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in
avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for
periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman,
pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast
of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the 
<span id="ed1922pg621"></span>
bissextile year
one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five
thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three
hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,
dominical <span id="ed1961pg668"></span>letters C B, Roman indication 2, Julian period 6617, MXMIV.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?
</p>
<p>
Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by
the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force
at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied
at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the
subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free
inflammable coal gas by turning <span id="ed1986pg546"></span>on the ventcock, lit a high flame which,
by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a
portable candle.
</p>
<p class="question">
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?
</p>
<p>
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a
candle, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man
leaving the kitchen holding a candle of 1 CP.
</p><span id="ed1932pg575"></span>
<p class="question">
Did the man reappear elsewhere?
</p>
<p>
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the
halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space
of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did Stephen obey his sign?
</p>
<p>
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed
softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted
candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down
a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's
house.
</p>
<p class="question">
What did Bloom do?
</p>
<p>
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its
flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for
Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when
necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid
resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons
of best Abram coal <span id="ed1961pg669"></span>at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs
Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier 
<span id="ed1922pg622"></span>
street, kindled it at three projecting
points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing
the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and
hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.
</p>
<p class="question">
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?
</p>
<p>
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,
had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the
college of the <a id="010008jesuit9" class="box-images" href="notes/010008jesuit.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a id="010157clongowes4" class="box-images" href="notes/010157clongowes.htm">Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the
county of Kildare</a>: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room
of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street:
of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss
Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of
number twelve North Richmond street <span id="ed1986pg547"></span>on the morning of the feast of
Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the
physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's Green, north: of
his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra.
</p>
<p class="question">
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from
the fire towards the opposite wall?
</p><span id="ed1932pg576"></span>
<p>
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,
stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the
chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs
folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of
ladies' grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual
position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer
extremities and the third at their point of junction.
</p>
<p class="question">
What did Bloom see on the range?
</p>
<p>
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left
(larger) hob a black iron kettle.
</p>
<p class="question">
What did Bloom do at the range?
</p>
<p>
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron
kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to
let it flow.
</p><span id="ed1961pg670"></span>
<p class="question">
Did it flow?
</p>
<p>
Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of
2.400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filtre 
<span id="ed1922pg623"></span>
mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial
plant cost of &pound; 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown,
Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan,
a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of
relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at
Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth
and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below
the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and
waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of
the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for
purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of
recourse being had to <a id="060016crossgunsbridge4" class="box-images" href="notes/060016crossgunsbridge.htm">the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals</a>
as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding
their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch
meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20.000 gallons per night by
a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of
the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the
detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers,
solvent, sound.
</p><span id="ed1986pg548"></span><span id="ed1932pg577"></span>
<p class="question">
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,
returning to the range, admire?
</p>
<p>
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature
in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's
projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific
exceeding 8.000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface
particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence
of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic
quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides:
its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar
icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance:
its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its
indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region
below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability
of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity <span id="ed1961pg671"></span>to dissolve
and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of
tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and
islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas
and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and
volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns:
its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones:
its vehicular ramifications in continental 
<span id="ed1922pg624"></span>
lakecontained streams and
confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic
currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence
in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,
freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,
cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:
its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and
latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments
and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown
gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its
composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part
of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead
Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate
dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst
and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and
paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow,
hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs
and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and
archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and
arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility
in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power
stations, bleachworks, <span id="ed1932pg578"></span>tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals,
rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality
derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level
to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe),
numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its
ubiquity as constituting 90 &#37; of the human <span id="ed1986pg549"></span>body: the noxiousness
of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded
flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.
</p>
<p class="question">
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he
return to the stillflowing tap?
</p>
<p>
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of
Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still <span id="ed1961pg672"></span>adhered, (bought
thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh
cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a
long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.
</p>
<p class="question">
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?
</p>
<p>
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of 
<span id="ed1922pg625"></span>
October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of
glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.
</p>
<p class="question">
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and
prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a
preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with
rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region
in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most
sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?
</p>
<p>
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.
</p>
<p class="question">
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?
</p>
<p>
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric
energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the
lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.
</p>
<p class="question">
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?
</p>
<p>
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and
recuperation.
</p><span id="ed1932pg579"></span>
<p class="question">
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the
agency of fire?
</p>
<p>
The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of
ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was
communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral
masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the
foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn
derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat
(radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous <span id="ed1961pg673"></span>diathermanous
ether. Heat <span id="ed1986pg550"></span>(convected), a mode of motion developed by such
combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source
of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated
through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part
reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising
the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in
temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal
units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50&deg; to 212&deg;
Fahrenheit.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg626"></span>
<p class="question">
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?
</p>
<p>
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at
both sides simultaneously.
</p>
<p class="question">
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?
</p>
<p>
To shave himself.
</p>
<p class="question">
What advantages attended shaving by night?
</p>
<p>
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from
shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly
encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours:
quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when
awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and
perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper
read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a
shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might
cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with
precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?
</p><span id="ed1932pg580"></span>
<p>
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine
feminine passive active hand.
</p>
<p class="question">
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting
influence?
</p>
<p>
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human
blood even when the end justified the means, <span id="ed1961pg674"></span>preferring, in their
natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic
surgery.
</p>
<p class="question">
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the
kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?
</p>
<p>
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal
breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a
moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white
goldrimmed eggcups, <span id="ed1986pg551"></span>an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly
copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits. On the middle shelf
a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four
conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of
<span id="ed1922pg627"></span>
Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and
containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and
Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue
paper, a packet of <a id="170006eppscocoa2" class="box-images" href="notes/170006eppscocoa.htm">Epps's soluble cocoa</a>, five ounces of Anne Lynch's
choice tea at 2/- per lb. in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical
canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one,
the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with
augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream,
a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured
adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and
semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr
Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total
quantity originally delivered, two cloves, <a id="010019money21" class="box-images" href="notes/010019money.htm">a halfpenny</a> and a small dish
containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of
jamjars of various sizes and proveniences.
</p>
<p class="question">
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?
</p>
<p>
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,
numbered 8 87, 8 86.
</p>
<p class="question">
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?
</p>
<p>
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction,
preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official
and definitive result of which he had read in <a id="020064telegraph8" class="box-images" href="notes/020064telegraph.htm">the <i>Evening Telegraph</i>,
late pink edition</a>, in the <a id="050012cabstands5" class="box-images" href="notes/050012cabstands.htm">cabman's shelter</a>, at <a id="070015buttbridge4" class="box-images" href="notes/070015buttbridge.htm">Butt bridge</a>.
</p><span id="ed1961pg675"></span><span id="ed1932pg581"></span>
<p class="question">
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected,
been received by him?
</p>
<p>
In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain
street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in <a id="060012liberatorsform3" class="box-images" href="notes/060012liberatorsform.htm">O'Connell
street lower</a>, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in
his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah,
restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of
F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick
M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and
restituted the copy of the current issue of the <i>Freeman's Journal and
National Press</i> which he had been about to throw away (subsequently
thrown away), he had proceeded towards <a id="050010mosquebaths3" class="box-images" href="notes/050010mosquebaths.htm">the oriental edifice of
the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street</a>, with the light of
<span id="ed1922pg628"></span>
inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the
secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.
</p><span id="ed1986pg552"></span>
<p class="question">
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?
</p>
<p>
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event
followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the
electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss
by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding
originally from a successful interpretation.
</p>
<p class="question">
His mood?
</p>
<p>
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he
was satisfied.
</p>
<p class="question">
What satisfied him?
</p>
<p>
To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to
others. Light to the gentiles.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?
</p>
<p>
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's
soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed
on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the
prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity
prescribed.
</p>
<p class="question">
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his
guest?
</p><span id="ed1961pg676"></span><span id="ed1932pg582"></span>
<p>
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation
Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly),
he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served
extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the
viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion
(Molly).
</p>
<p class="question">
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of
hospitality?
</p>
<p>
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted
them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct,
the creature cocoa.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg629"></span>
<p class="question">
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,
reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to
complete the act begun?
</p>
<p>
The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right
side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four
lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable
condition.
</p><span id="ed1986pg553"></span>
<p class="question">
Who drank more quickly?
</p>
<p>
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking,
from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady
flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to
two, nine to three.
</p>
<p class="question">
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?
</p>
<p>
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from
literature of instruction rather than of amusement as <a id="020032moneypurse2" class="box-images" href="notes/020032moneypurse.htm">he himself had
applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the
solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life</a>.
</p>
<p class="question">
Had he found their solution?
</p>
<p>
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,
aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,
the answers not bearing in all points.
</p>
<p class="question">
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,
potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion <span id="ed1961pg677"></span>of the offering

</p>
<p class="question">
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?
</p>
<p>
Name, age, race, creed.

What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?

What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic
poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?
</p>
<p class="lyrics"> <i>Poets oft have sung in rhyme <br />

What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G.
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,
entitled <i>If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now</i>,
commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,
49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the

with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high
sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket

</p>
<p class="question">
What relation existed between their ages?
</p>
<p>
16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen
was 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present
age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54
their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according
as arbitrary future years<span id="ed1986pg555"></span> were added, for if the proportion existing in
1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then
1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen
would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when
Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom,
being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have
surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah,
969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would
attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to
have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in
the year 81,396 B.C.
</p>
<p class="question">
What events might nullify these calculations?
</p>
<p>
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration <span id="ed1961pg679"></span>of a
<span id="ed1932pg585"></span>new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent
extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.
</p>
<p class="question">
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?
</p>
<p>
Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina
Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's
mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his
hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a
rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father
and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg632"></span>
<p class="question">
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and
afterwards seconded by the father?
</p>
<p>
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative
gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a
third connecting link between them?
</p>
<p>
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the
house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and
had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the <a id="020066cityarms12" class="box-images" href="notes/020066cityarms.htm">City Arms
Hotel</a> owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts
of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom
who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the
employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of
sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.
</p>
<p class="question">
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?
</p>
<p>
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow
of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair
with <span id="ed1986pg556"></span>slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North
Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had
remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular
fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles
equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,
<span id="ed1961pg680"></span>private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from
the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?
</p><span id="ed1932pg586"></span>
<p>
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel
of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with
continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,
velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round
and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.
</p>
<p class="question">
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years
deceased?
</p>
<p>
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient
catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue
of the Immaculate Conception, 
<span id="ed1922pg633"></span>
her green and maroon brushes for Charles
Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.
</p>
<p class="question">
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation
which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the
more desirable?
</p>
<p>
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's <i>Physical Strength and How to
Obtain It</i> which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in
sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in
front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of
muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant
relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.
</p>
<p class="question">
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?
</p>
<p>
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full
circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he
had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever
movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed
abdominal muscles.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?
</p>
<p>
Neither.
</p><span id="ed1961pg681"></span><span id="ed1986pg557"></span>
<p class="question">
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts
about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about
Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?
</p>
<p>
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he
knew that he knew that he was not.
</p><span id="ed1932pg587"></span>
<p class="question">
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective
parentages?
</p>
<p>
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently
Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and
Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born
Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest surviving male
consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary,
daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg634"></span>
<p class="question">
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or
layman?
</p>
<p>
Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A., alone,
in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, <a id="050014thecoombe5" class="box-images" href="notes/050014thecoombe.htm">Coombe</a>, by James
O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump
in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in
the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend
Charles Malone C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons,
Rathgar.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did they find their educational careers similar?
</p>
<p>
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively
through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for
Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,
junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the
matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the
royal university.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university
of life?
</p>
<p>
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation
had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.
</p><span id="ed1961pg682"></span>
<p class="question">
What two temperaments did they individually represent?
</p>
<p>
The scientific. The artistic.
</p><span id="ed1986pg558"></span>
<p class="question">
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards
applied, rather than towards pure, science?
</p>
<p>
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining
in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his
<span id="ed1932pg588"></span>appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once
revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting
telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water
siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.
</p>
<p class="question">
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of
kindergarten?
</p>
<p>
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,
catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve 
<span id="ed1922pg635"></span>
constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature
mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical
to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls,
historically costumed dolls.
</p>
<p class="question">
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?
</p>
<p>
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James,
the former by his 1d. bazaar at 42 George's Street, South, the latter
at his 6 1/2d. shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30
Henry street, admission 2d., children 1d.: and the infinite possibilities
hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed
in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility
(divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of
magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to
convince, to decide.

<span id="ed1922pg636"></span>
<p class="question">
Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that
originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably
conduce to success?
</p>
<p>
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn
by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be
seated engaged in writing.

<p class="question">
What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?

</p>
<p class="question">
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?
</p>
<p>
The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, County Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf
Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,
in consequence of <a id="150007aconite1" class="box-images" href="notes/150007aconite.htm">an overdose of monkshood (aconite)</a> selfadministered in
the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment
to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the
<span id="ed1961pg684"></span>morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17
Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having,
purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater
straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of
having, purchased at the hour and in <span id="ed1986pg560"></span>the place aforesaid), the toxin
aforesaid, at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street,
Ennis.
</p><span id="ed1932pg590"></span>
<p class="question">
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or
intuition?
</p>
<p>
Coincidence.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?
</p>
<p>
He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's
words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament
relieved.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg637"></span>
<p class="question">
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to
him, described by the narrator as <i>A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The
Parable of the Plums</i>?
</p>
<p>
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by
implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms
(e.g. <i>My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time</i>)
composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and
in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of
financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially
collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent
merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or
contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy
or Doctor Dick or Heblon's <i>Studies in Blue</i>, to a publication of
certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual
stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful
narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during
the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice

Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.

Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other
frequently engaged his mind?

<p>
What to do with our wives.
</p><span id="ed1961pg685"></span>
<p class="question">
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?
</p>
<p>
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,
nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts,
chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the
policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano
and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing:
biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as
pleasantly commanding and <span id="ed1986pg561"></span>pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in
a cool dairy <span id="ed1932pg591"></span>shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of
erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically
controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals
and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female
acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of
evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction
agreeable.
</p>
<p class="question">
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him
in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg638"></span>
<p>
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper
with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and
Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals
as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of
a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political
complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating
the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.
After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned
the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to
the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual
polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false
analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), <i>alias</i> (a
mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).
</p>
<p class="question">
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and
such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?
</p>
<p>
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all
balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her
proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.
</p><span id="ed1961pg686"></span>
<p class="question">
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?
</p>
<p>
Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a
certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent
knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's
ignorant lapse.
</p>
<p class="question">
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?
</p>
<p>
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest
comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty
remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated
with error.
</p><span id="ed1986pg562"></span><span id="ed1932pg592"></span>
<p class="question">
What system had proved more effective?
</p>
<p>
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.
</p>
<p class="question">
Example?
</p>
<p>
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she
disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new
hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg639"></span>
<p class="question">
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of
postexilic eminence did he adduce?
</p>
<p>
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,
author of <i>More Nebukim</i> (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn
of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there
arose none like Moses (Maimonides).
</p>
<p class="question">
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth
seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by
Stephen?
</p>
<p>
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,
name uncertain.
</p>
<p class="question">
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a
selected or rejected race mentioned?
</p>
<p>
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),
Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).
</p>
<p class="question">
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and <span id="ed1961pg687"></span>ancient Irish
languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts
by guest to host and by host to guest?
</p>
<p>
By Stephen: <i>suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin</i>
(walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).
</p>
<p>
By Bloom: <i>Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch</i> (thy temple
amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).
</p>
<p class="question">
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages
made in substantiation of the oral comparison?
</p>
<p>
By juxtaposition. On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior
literary style, entituled <i>Sweets of Sin</i> (produced by Bloom and so
manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of
the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish
characters for gee, eh,<span id="ed1932pg593"></span> dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn
wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of
<span id="ed1986pg563"></span>mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal
and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.

Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the
extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?
</p>
<p>
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence
and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.
</p>
<p class="question">
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the
peoples who spoke them?
</p>
<p>
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and
servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been
taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary
instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel,
and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their
archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homilectic,
toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works
of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor,
Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth,
Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the
isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.
Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription
of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the
<span id="ed1961pg688"></span>restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish
political autonomy or devolution.

</p>
<p class="question">
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?
</p>
<p>
In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?
</p>
<p>
By a periphrastic version of the general text.
</p><span id="ed1932pg594"></span>
<p class="question">
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?
</p>
<p>
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic
hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of
modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions
(Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).

Did the guest comply with his host's request?
</p>
<p>
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.

What was Stephen's auditive sensation?
</p>
<p>
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation
of the past.

What was Bloom's visual sensation?
</p>
<p>
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a

<p class="question">
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange
legend on an allied theme?
</p>
<p>
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being

<span id="ed1922pg644"></span>
<p class="question">
Condense Stephen's commentary.
</p>
<p>
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by
inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he
is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope
and youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation,
to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him,
consenting.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?
</p>
<p>
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him
should by him not be told.
</p><span id="ed1932pg597"></span>
<p class="question">
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?
</p>
<p>
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?
</p>
<p>
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the
propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of
opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of
atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,
hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.
</p><span id="ed1986pg567"></span>
<p class="question">
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not
totally immune?
</p>
<p>
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his
sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an
indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From
somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and
crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained
its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,
sleeping.
</p>
<p class="question">
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member
of his family?
</p>
<p>
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation
of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night
attire with a vacant mute expression.
</p><span id="ed1961pg692"></span>
<span id="ed1922pg645"></span>
<p class="question">
What other infantile memories had he of her?
</p>
<p>
15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and
lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks
her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,
tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,
she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau,
Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British
navy.
</p>
<p class="question">
What endemic characteristics were present?
</p>
<p>
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct
line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant
intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.
</p><span id="ed1932pg598"></span>
<p class="question">
What memories had he of her adolescence?
</p>
<p>
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn,
entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and
take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South
Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual
of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned
abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th
anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county
Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year
not stated).
</p>
<p class="question">
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?
</p>
<p>
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.
</p><span id="ed1986pg568"></span>
<p class="question">
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,
if differently?
</p>
<p>
A temporary departure of his cat.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why similarly, why differently?
</p>
<p>
Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male
(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently,
because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the
habitation.
</p>
<p class="question">
In other respects were their differences similar?
</p>
<p>
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in
unexpectedness.
</p><span id="ed1961pg693"></span>
<span id="ed1922pg646"></span>
<p class="question">
As?
</p>
<p>
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it
for her (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake
in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented
spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the
constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf
mousewatching cat).  Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences
of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf
earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had
an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been
Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which
it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat). Hence, in
passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness,
their differences were similar.
</p><span id="ed1932pg599"></span>
<p class="question">
In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, (2) a clock, given as
matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?
</p>
<p>
As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous
animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of
vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the
pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation
in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of
clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the
recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the
shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, <i>videlicet</i>, 5
5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.
</p>
<p class="question">
In what manners did she reciprocate?
</p>
<p>
She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to
him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.
She <span id="ed1986pg569"></span>provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases
had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his
necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon
having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire
to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the
moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.

<span id="ed1922pg647"></span><span id="ed1961pg694"></span>
<p class="question">
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make
to Stephen, noctambulist?
</p>
<p>
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and
Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately
above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of
his host and hostess.
</p>
<p class="question">
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation
of such an extemporisation?
</p>
<p>
For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the
host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the
hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian
pronunciation.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and
a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's
daughter?
</p>
<p>
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother
through daughter.
</p><span id="ed1932pg600"></span>
<p class="question">
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest
return a monosyllabic negative answer?
</p>
<p>
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney
Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.
</p>
<p class="question">
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the
host?
</p>
<p>
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment
of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the
anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).
</p>
<p class="question">
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?
</p>
<p>
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.
</p><span id="ed1986pg570"></span>
<p class="question">
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?
</p>
<p>
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money

the former.

<p class="question">
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,
declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?
</p>
<p>
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place
the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal
instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate
a series of static semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,
places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in
the same place), the <a id="010049shiptavern4" class="box-images" href="notes/010049shiptavern.htm"><em>Ship</em> hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and

or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line
drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in
different places). </p>
<p class="question">
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually
selfexcluding propositions?
</p>
<p>
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert
Hengler's circus in <a id="060011therotunda3" class="box-images" href="notes/060011therotunda.htm">the Rotunda, Rutland square,</a> Dublin, an intuitive
particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring
to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was<span id="ed1932pg601"></span>publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his
(the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the
summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked<a id="010019money28" class="box-images" href="notes/010019money.htm"> a florin (2/-)</a> with three notches
on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and
received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand
Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,
circuitous or direct, return.
</p>
<p class="question">
Was the clown Bloom's son?
</p>
<p>
No.
</p>
<p class="question">
Had Bloom's coin returned?
</p>
<p>
Never.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?
</p>
<p>
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to
amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and
international animosity. 
</p><span id="ed1961pg696"></span><span id="ed1986pg571"></span>
<span id="ed1922pg649"></span>
<p class="question">
He believed then that human life was infinitely
perfectible, eliminating these conditions?
</p>
<p>
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct
from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of
destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of
the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and
death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human
females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable
accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies
and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital
criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make
terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres
of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital
growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through
maturity to decay.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why did he desist from speculation?
</p>
<p>
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena
to be removed.
</p><span id="ed1932pg602"></span>
<p class="question">
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?
</p>
<p>
He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding
syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational
reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the
incertitude of the void.
</p>
<p class="question">
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?
</p>
<p>
Not verbally. Substantially.
</p>
<p class="question">
What comforted his misapprehension?
</p>
<p>
That as a <a id="010146hugekey6" class="box-images" href="notes/010146hugekey.htm">competent keyless citizen</a> he had proceeded energetically from
the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.

<p class="question">
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his
companion of various constellations?
</p><span id="ed1932pg603"></span>
<p>
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in
incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous
scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an
observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000
ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius
(alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant
and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the
precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and
nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund
and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging
towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic
drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from
immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with
which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a
parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.
</p><span id="ed1961pg698"></span>
<p class="question">
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?
</p>
<p>
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the
earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed
in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds,
of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable
trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained
by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single 
<span id="ed1922pg651"></span>
pinhead: of the universe
of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves
universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in
continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was
again divisible in divisions of redivisible <span id="ed1986pg573"></span>component bodies, dividends
and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the
progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?
</p>
<p>
Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem
of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a
number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude
and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that,
the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000
pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to
be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed
integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds <span id="ed1932pg604"></span>of millions,
billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series
containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost
kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their
satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and
moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?
</p>
<p>
Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,
normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons,
when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere
suffered with arithmetical progression <span id="ed1961pg699"></span>of intensity, according as
the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was
approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,
when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a
working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more
adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might
subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian,
Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though
an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite
differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would
probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to
vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.

monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms:
the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a
star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and
day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in
incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the
birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting
constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of <span id="ed1961pg700"></span>similar
origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared
from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period
of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar
origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared
from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of
Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years
after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from
other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of
other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar,
from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow,
taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular
animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters,
pallor of human beings.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg653"></span>
<p class="question">
His (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing
for possible error?
</p>
<p>
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not
a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from
the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the
suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of
different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space,
remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a
present before its probable spectators had entered actual present
existence.
</p><span id="ed1986pg575"></span>
<p class="question">
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?
</p>
<p>
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the
delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection
invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the
satellite of their planet.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological
influences upon sublunary disasters?
</p><span id="ed1932pg606"></span>
<p>
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the
nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to
verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the
sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.
</p><span id="ed1961pg701"></span>
<p class="question">
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and
woman?
</p>
<p>
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian
generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence:
her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising
and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced
invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative
interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power
to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to
incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her
visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent
propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her
light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her
arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction,
when invisible.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg654"></span>
<p class="question">
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's,
gaze?
</p>
<p>
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a
paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller
blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving
shutter manufacturer, 16 <a id="170002aungierstreet" class="box-images" href="notes/170002aungierstreet.htm">Aungier street</a>.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his
wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?
</p>
<p>
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued
affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with
suggestion.
</p><span id="ed1986pg576"></span>
<p class="question">
Both then were silent?
</p>
<p>
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal
flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.
</p>
<p class="question">
Were they indefinitely inactive?
</p>
<p>
At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen,
then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs
of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition,
<span id="ed1932pg607"></span>their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected
luminous and semiluminous shadow.
</p><span id="ed1961pg702"></span>
<p class="question">
Similarly?
</p>
<p>
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations
were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of
the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate
year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point
of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the
institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the
ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption
an insistent vesical pressure.
</p>
<p class="question">
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the
invisible audible collateral organ of the other?
</p>
<p>
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,
reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pelosity.
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised
(I January, holiday of obligation to hear mass 
<span id="ed1922pg655"></span>
and abstain from
unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to <a id="010087prepuces2" class="box-images" href="notes/010087prepuces.htm">whether the divine
prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic
church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of
the fourth degree of latria</a> accorded to the abscission of such divine
excrescences as hair and toenails.
</p>
<p class="question">
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?
</p>
<p>
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament
from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress
of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal
departer?
</p>
<p>
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an
unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and
turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its
staple, pulling inward <span id="ed1986pg577"></span>spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and
revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?
</p>
<p>
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its
base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at <span id="ed1961pg703"></span>any point and
forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.
</p><span id="ed1932pg608"></span>
<p class="question">
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their
(respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?
</p>
<p>
<a id="040008georgeschurch6" class="box-images" href="notes/040008georgeschurch.htm">The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells
in the church of Saint George.</a>
</p>
<p class="question">
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?
</p>
<p>
By Stephen:
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
<a id="010082liliatarutilantium5" class="box-media" href="notes/010082liliatarutilantium.htm"><i>Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.</i></a> <br />
Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.</i>
</p>
<p>
By Bloom:
</p>
<p class="lyrics"><i>Heigho, heigho, <br />
     Heigho, heigho.</i>
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg656"></span>
<p class="question">
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day
at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south
to Glasnevin in the north?
</p>
<p>
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed),
Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John
Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed),
Paddy Dignam (in the grave).
</p>
<p class="question">
Alone, what did Bloom hear?
</p>
<p>
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the
double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.
</p>
<p class="question">
Alone, what did Bloom feel?
</p>
<p>
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing
point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Reaumur: the
incipient intimations of proximate dawn.
</p>
<p class="question">
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind
him?
</p>
<p>
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy
Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,
Jervis <span id="ed1986pg578"></span>Street hospital), Matthew F. <span id="ed1961pg704"></span>Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin
Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis,
<a id="010068themater6" class="box-images-med" href="notes/010068themater.htm">Mater Misericordiae hospital</a>), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).
</p><span id="ed1932pg609"></span>
<p class="question">
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?
</p>
<p>
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the
apparition of a new solar disk.
</p>
<p class="question">
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?
</p>
<p>
Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house
of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition
of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the
direction of Mizrach, the east.
</p>
<p class="question">
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?
</p>
<p>
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at
various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,
the visible diffusion 
<span id="ed1922pg657"></span>
of the light of an invisible luminous body, the
first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.
</p>
<p class="question">
Did he remain?
</p>
<p>
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering
the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the
candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room,
hallfloor, and reentered.
</p>
<p class="question">
What suddenly arrested his ingress?
</p>
<p>
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into
contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible
fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in
consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.
</p>
<p class="question">
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of
furniture.
</p>
<p>
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite
the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an
alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and
white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the
door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard
(a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) <span id="ed1961pg705"></span>had
been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but
more perilous position <span id="ed1986pg579"></span>in front of the door: two chairs had been moved
from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied
by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.
</p><span id="ed1932pg610"></span>
<p class="question">
Describe them.
</p>
<p>
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back
slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an
irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply
upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed
directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat
to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of
white plaited rush.
</p>
<p class="question">
What significances attached to these two chairs?
</p>
<p>
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial
evidence, of testimonial supermanence.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg658"></span>
<p class="question">
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?
</p>
<p>
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin
supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray
containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two
discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in
the key of G natural for voice and piano of <i>Love's Old Sweet Song</i>
(words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam
Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications
<i>ad libitum, forte</i>, pedal, <i>animato</i>, sustained, pedal, <i>ritirando</i>,
close.
</p>
<p class="question">
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?
</p>
<p>
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right
temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on
a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,
bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,
remembering <a id="010031snotgreen2" class="box-images" href="notes/010031snotgreen.htm">Dr Malachi Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the
gradation of green</a>: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent
act and perceiving <span id="ed1961pg706"></span>through various channels of internal sensibility
the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual
discolouration.
</p>
<p class="question">
His next proceeding?
</p>
<p>
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black
diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on
a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the
mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus
(illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined
it <span id="ed1932pg611"></span>superficially, <span id="ed1986pg580"></span>rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the
latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin
of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to
facilitate total combustion.
</p>
<p class="question">
What followed this operation?
</p>
<p>
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a
vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.
</p>
<p class="question">
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the
mantelpiece?
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg659"></span>
<p>
A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46
a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of<a id="170008precedingseries27" class="box-images" href="notes/170008precedingseries.htm"> Matthew Dillon</a>: a dwarf
tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial
gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of
<a id="170008precedingseries28" class="box-images" href="notes/170008precedingseries.htm">Alderman John Hooper</a>.
</p>
<p class="question">
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and
Bloom?
</p>
<p>
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before
the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear
melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom
while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated
gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.
</p>
<p class="question">
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his
attention?
</p><span id="ed1961pg707"></span>
<p>
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?
</p>
<p class="lyrics">
<i>Brothers and sisters had he none. <br />
Yet that man's father was his grandfather's son.</i>
</p>
<p class="question">
Why mutable (aliorelative)?
</p>
<p>
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal
procreator.
</p><span id="ed1932pg612"></span>
<p class="question">
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?
</p>
<p>
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged
and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles
on the two bookshelves opposite.

<p class="question">
What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of

</p>
<p>
The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its
place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females:
the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella
inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document
behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.

<p>

What among other data did the second volume of the work in question
contain?
</p>
<p>
The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a
decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).
</p>
<p class="question">
Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?
</p>
<p>
Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to consult
the work 
<span id="ed1922pg662"></span>
in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the
military engagement, Plevna.
</p>
<p class="question">
What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?
</p>
<p>
The candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a
statue erect in the centre of the table, <a id="080005venus9" class="box-images" href="notes/080005venus.htm">an image of Narcissus</a> purchased
by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.
</p><span id="ed1932pg614"></span>
<p class="question">
What caused him irritation in his sitting posture? 
</p>
<p>
Inhibitory pressure
of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing
superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations
of mass by expansion.
</p>
<p class="question">
How was the irritation allayed?
</p>
<p>
He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible
stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He
unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt
and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs
extending in triangular <span id="ed1986pg583"></span>convergence from the pelvic basin over the
circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial
line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae,
thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles
described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits
of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus
one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.
</p>
<p class="question">
What involuntary actions followed?
</p>
<p>
He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in
the left infracostal region below the diaphragm <span id="ed1961pg710"></span>resulting from a sting
inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee.
He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of
prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly
abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of
his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling),
placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the
interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

<p class="question">Did the process of divestiture continue?</p>
<p>
Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended
his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient
points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in
several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots,
unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the
second <span id="ed1961pg711"></span>time, <span id="ed1986pg584"></span>detached the partially moistened right sock through the
fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised
his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender,
took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin
of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding
part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and
inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the
lacerated unguical fragment.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg664"></span>
<p class="question">
Why with satisfaction?
</p>
<p>
Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other
unguical fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs
Ellis's juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief
genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.

K. P., L. L. D. <i>honoris causa</i>, Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in
court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left
Kingstown for England).
</p>
<p class="question">
What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?
</p><span id="ed1961pg715"></span>
<p>
A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour:
the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes,
incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality,
of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants
of the widest possible latitude but exactable <a id="010019money14" class="box-images" href="notes/010019money.htm">to the uttermost farthing</a>
with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. Loyal to
the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of
rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order,
the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every
measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be
contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter
of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in
covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations,
all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of
venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators
of international persecution, all perpetuators of international
animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all
recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg668"></span>
<p class="question">
Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.</p>
<p>
To Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his
disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his
father Rudolf Virag (later Rudolph Bloom) had been converted from the
Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting
Christianity among the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of
Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony
in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile
friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he
had advocated <span id="ed1986pg588"></span>during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of
colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of
Charles Darwin, expounded in <i>The Descent of Man</i> and <i>The Origin
of Species</i>. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the
collective <span id="ed1932pg620"></span>and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan
Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O'Brien and others,
the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of
Charles Stewart Parnell (M. P. for Cork City), the programme of
peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M. P. for
Midlothian, N. B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had
climbed up <span id="ed1961pg716"></span>into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree
on Northumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the
capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000 torchbearers,
divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2000 torches in escort of
the marquess of Ripon and John Morley.
</p>
<p class="question">
How much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p class="question">
Were there schemes of wider scope?
</p>
<p>
A scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour
commissioners for the exploitation of white coal (hydraulic power),
obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at
head of water at Poulaphouca or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main
streams for the economic production of 500,000 W. H. P. of electricity.

<p class="question">
Positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes
become a natural and necessary apodosis?

<p>
Given a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of

after donor's painless extinction, of eminent financiers (Blum Pasha,
Rothschild Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller)

joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.
</p>
<p class="question">
What eventuality would render him independent of such wealth?
</p>
<p>
The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.
</p>
<p class="question">
For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?
</p><span id="ed1961pg719"></span>
<p>
It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic
relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil
recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for
the <span id="ed1932pg623"></span>night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and
renovated vitality.
</p>
<p class="question">
His justifications?
</p>
<p>
As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human
life at least 2/7, viz., 20 years are passed in sleep. As a philosopher
he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an
infinitesimal part of any person's desires has been realised. As a
physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant
agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.
</p><span id="ed1986pg591"></span>
<p class="question">
What did he fear?
</p>
<p>
The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration
of the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence
situated in the cerebral convolutions.
</p>
<p class="question">
What were habitually his final meditations?
</p>
<p>
Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in
wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded,
reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span
of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life.

<p class="question">
How did absentminded beggar's concluding testimonial conclude?
</p>
<p>

a nurse, Miss Callan (Christian name unknown), a maid, Gertrude (Gerty,
family name unknown).
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg674"></span>
<p class="question">
What possibility suggested itself?
</p>
<p>
The possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the not

<p class="question">
Quote the textual terms of this notice.
</p>
<p>
I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at n&deg; 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin,
formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice
that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all
times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.
</p>
<p class="question">
What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the
2nd drawer?
</p>
<p>
An indistinct daguerreotype of Rudolph Virag and his father Leopold
Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their
(respectively) 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar,
Hungary. An ancient haggadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex
spectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual
prayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the Queen's Hotel,
Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed: <i>To My Dear Son
Leopold</i>.
</p><span id="ed1986pg594"></span>
<span id="ed1922pg675"></span>
<p class="question">
What fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words
evoke?
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow will be a week that I received... it is no use Leopold to be
... with your dear mother... that is not more to stand... to her...
all for me is out... be kind to <a id="060004athos2" class="box-images" href="notes/060004athos.htm">Athos</a>, Leopold... my dear son...
always... of me... <i>das Herz... Gott... dein</i>...
</p><span id="ed1961pg723"></span>
<p class="question">
What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive
melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?
</p>
<p>
An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered,
sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: <a id="150007aconite3" class="box-images" href="notes/150007aconite.htm">aconite, resorted to by increasing doses
of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia</a>: the
face in death of a septuagenarian suicide by poison.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?
</p>
<p>
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain
beliefs and practices.
</p><span id="ed1932pg627"></span>
<p class="question">
As?
</p>
<p>
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal, the
hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete
mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of
male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the
ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.
</p>
<p class="question">
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?
</p>
<p>
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than
other beliefs and practices now appeared.
</p>
<p class="question">
What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?
</p>
<p>
Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a
retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between
Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with
statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia,
empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having
taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).
Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant
consultation of a geographical map 
<span id="ed1922pg676"></span>
of Europe (political) and by
suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the
various centres mentioned.
</p><span id="ed1986pg595"></span>
<p class="question">
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these
migrations in narrator and listener?
</p>
<p>
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of
narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in <span id="ed1961pg724"></span>consequence of
the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.
</p>
<p class="question">
What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of
amnesia?
</p>
<p>
Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.
Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an
inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food
by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.
</p>
<p class="question">
What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?
</p>
<p>
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon
repletion.
</p><span id="ed1932pg628"></span>
<p class="question">
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?
</p>
<p>
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the
possession of scrip.
</p>
<p class="question">
Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which
these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values
to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.
</p>
<p>
Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor
hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and
doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy:
that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1/4d.
in the &pound;, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant,
insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated
bailiffs man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric
public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded
perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man's House (Royal
Hospital) Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson's Hospital for reduced but
respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of
<span id="ed1922pg677"></span>
misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic
pauper.
</p>
<p class="question">
With which attendant indignities?
</p>
<p>
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the
contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of <span id="ed1961pg725"></span>fragments of bread,
the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of
illegitimate unlicensed <span id="ed1986pg596"></span>vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of
decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less
than nothing.
</p>
<p class="question">
By what could such a situation be precluded?
</p>
<p>
By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).
</p>
<p class="question">
Which preferably?
</p>
<p>
The latter, by the line of least resistance.
</p>
<p class="question">
What considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?
</p>
<p>
Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.
The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity
to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.
</p><span id="ed1932pg629"></span>
<p class="question">
What considerations rendered it not irrational?
</p>
<p>
The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which
being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if
not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,
which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting
parties, which was impossible.
</p>
<p class="question">
What considerations rendered it desirable?
</p>
<p>
The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,
as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or
in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and
hachures.
</p>
<p class="question">
In Ireland?
</p>
<p>
The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with
submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort
Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the
pastures of royal Meath, Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island
shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg678"></span>
<p class="question">
Abroad?
</p>
<p>
Ceylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for
Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing Lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame
street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city <span id="ed1961pg726"></span>(with mosque of Omar and gate
of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique
birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues, nude
Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled
international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where
<span id="ed1986pg597"></span>O'Hara of the Camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human
being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters
of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller
returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.
</p>
<p class="question">
Under what guidance, following what signs?
</p>
<p>
At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of
intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior produced
and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled
triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha
delta of Ursa Maior. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed
<span id="ed1932pg630"></span>in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice
of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating
female, a pillar of the cloud by day.
</p>
<p class="question">
What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?
</p>
<p>
&pound; 5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from <a id="040005seveneccles7" class="box-images" href="notes/040005seveneccles.htm">his residence 7 Eccles
street</a>, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold
(Poldy), height 5 ft., 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may
have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above
sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery.
</p>
<p class="question">
What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and
nonentity?
</p>
<p>
Assumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.
</p>
<p class="question">
What tributes his?
</p>
<p>
Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph
immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg679"></span>
<p class="question">
Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?
</p>
<p>
Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his
cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic
planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the <span id="ed1961pg727"></span>extreme boundary of
space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere
imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey
the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of
the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the
constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination
return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark
crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition)
surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.
</p><span id="ed1986pg598"></span>
<p class="question">
What would render such return irrational?
</p>
<p>
An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through
reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible
time.
</p>
<p class="question">
What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?
</p>
<p>
The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity
of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,
<span id="ed1932pg631"></span>rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the
proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of
warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and
rendering desirable: <a id="080005venus10" class="box-images" href="notes/080005venus.htm">the statue of Narcissus</a>, sound without echo,
desired desire.
</p>
<p class="question">
What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an
unoccupied bed?
</p>
<p>
The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human
(mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of
matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the
case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the
spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).
</p>
<p class="question">
What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of
accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?
</p>
<p>
The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and
premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the
funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and
<span id="ed1922pg680"></span>
Thummim): the <span id="ed1961pg728"></span>unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchisedek): the visit to
museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford
row, Merchants' Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the
Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte
in Bernard Kiernan's premises (holocaust): a blank period of time
including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking
(wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of
Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering):
the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, <a id="150005nighttown2" class="box-images" href="notes/150005nighttown.htm">82 Tyrone
street, lower</a> and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street
(Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman's shelter,
Butt Bridge (atonement).
</p>
<p class="question">
What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to
conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?
</p>
<p>
The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by
the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.
</p><span id="ed1986pg599"></span>
<p class="question">
What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured
multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not
comprehend?
</p>
<p>
Who was M'Intosh?
</p><span id="ed1932pg632"></span>
<p class="question">
What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30
years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction
of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?
</p>
<p>
Where was Moses when the candle went out?
</p>
<p class="question">
What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with
collected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel, silently,
successively, enumerate?
</p>
<p>
A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain
a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook,
Robertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E.
C.): to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in
the case of Hellenic female divinities: <a id="110002atfourshe8" class="box-images" href="notes/110002atfourshe.htm">to obtain admission (gratuitous
or paid) to the performance of <em>Leah</em> by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the Gaiety
Theatre</a>, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street. </p>
<span id="ed1922pg681"></span><span id="ed1961pg729"></span>
<p class="question">
What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?
</p>
<p>
The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin
Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin's Barn.
</p>
<p class="question">
What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by hypothesis?
</p>
<p>
Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens
street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines
meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from
infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the
Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.
</p>
<p class="question">
What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were
perceived by him?
</p>
<p>
A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new
violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on
generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish
cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded
curvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion
underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed
irregularly on the top of a rectangular <span id="ed1986pg600"></span>trunk, quadruple battened,
having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore
side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).
</p>
<p class="question">
What impersonal objects were perceived?
</p>
<p>
A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne
<span id="ed1932pg633"></span>cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat.
Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware
and ironmongery manufacturer, <a id="080003moorestreet2" class="box-images" href="notes/080003moorestreet.htm">21, 22, 23 Moore Street</a>, disposed
irregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin, soapdish
and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article
(on the floor, separate).
</p>
<p class="question">
Bloom's acts?
</p>
<p>
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining
articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the
bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the
proper apertures of the nightshirt, <span id="ed1961pg730"></span>removed a pillow from the head to
the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the
bed.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg682"></span>
<p class="question">
How?
</p>
<p>
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or
not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress
being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous
under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of
lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of
conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of
marriage, of sleep and of death.
</p>
<p class="question">
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?
</p>
<p>
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,
female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,
some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.
</p>
<p class="question">
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?
</p>
<p>
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to
enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if
the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,
last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor
alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.
</p>
<p class="question">
<a id="170008precedingseries1" class="box-images" href="notes/170008precedingseries.htm">What preceding series?</a>
</p>
<p>
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell
d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father
<span id="ed1986pg601"></span>Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse <span id="ed1932pg634"></span>Show,
Maggot O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor
of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder,
an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon
Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John
Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack
at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so
on to no last term.
</p>
<p class="question">
What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and
late occupant of the bed?
</p><span id="ed1961pg731"></span>
<p>
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a
billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a
boaster).
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg683"></span>
<p class="question">
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal
proportion and commercial ability?
</p>
<p>
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding
members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably
transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with
desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene
comprehension and apprehension.
</p>
<p class="question">
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections
affected?
</p>
<p>
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.
</p>
<p class="question">
Envy?
</p>
<p>
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic
piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of
a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental
female organism, passive but not obtuse.
</p>
<p class="question">
Jealousy?
</p>
<p>
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately
the agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between agent(s)
and reagents at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of
increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial
reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of
attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.
</p><span id="ed1932pg635"></span>
<p class="question">
Abnegation?
</p>
<p>
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden
Quay, b) hospitality <span id="ed1986pg602"></span>extended and received in kind, reciprocated and
reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of
ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)
extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative,
e) an <span id="ed1961pg732"></span>imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net
proceeds divided.
</p>
<p class="question">
Equanimity?
</p>

As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or
understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with 
<span id="ed1922pg684"></span>
his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.
As not as calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in
consequence of a collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than
theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money
under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public
money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of
minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason,
felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking,
practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field,
perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies,
impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated
murder. As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of
adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal
equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances,
foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant
disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.
</p>
<p class="question">
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?
</p>
<p>
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially
violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the
adulterously violated.
</p>
<p class="question">
What retribution, if any?
</p>
<p>
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by
combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic
bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not <span id="ed1932pg636"></span>yet. Suit
for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of
injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. Hushmoney by moral
influence possibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of
emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral,
a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation,
humiliation, separation <span id="ed1961pg733"></span>protecting the one separated from the other,
protecting separator from both.
</p><span id="ed1986pg603"></span>
<p class="question">
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of
incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?
</p>
<p>
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility
of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between
the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the
selfabbreviating 
<span id="ed1922pg685"></span>
relaxation of the thing done; the fallaciously inferred
debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of
ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving
no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as
masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct
feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist
preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb
and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary
masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of
seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by
distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the
inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy
of the stars.
</p>
<p class="question">
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and
reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?
</p>
<p>
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial
hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored
(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of
Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female
hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and
seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,
insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,
expressive of mute immutable mature animality.
</p>
<p class="question">
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?
</p>
<p>
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a
tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.
</p><span id="ed1932pg637"></span>
<p class="question">
Then?
</p>
<p>
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each
plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow <span id="ed1961pg734"></span>yellow furrow, with obscure
prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.
</p>
<p class="question">
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?
</p>
<p>
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a
solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.
</p><span id="ed1986pg604"></span>
<p class="question">
What followed this silent action?
</p>
<p>
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,
catechetical interrogation.
</p>
<span id="ed1922pg686"></span>
<p class="question">
With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?
</p>
<p>
Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between
Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and
in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and C&deg;,
Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation
and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty),
surname unknown. Positive: <a id="110002atfourshe9" class="box-images" href="notes/110002atfourshe.htm">he included mention of a performance by Mrs
Bandmann Palmer of <i>Leah</i> at the Gaiety Theatre</a>, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King
street, an invitation to supper at Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel, 35, 36 and
37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency
entituled <i>Sweets of Sin</i>, anonymous author a gentleman of fashion, a
temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the
course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely
recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving
son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat
executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor
and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic
flexibility.
</p>
<p class="question">
Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?
</p>
<p>
Absolutely.
</p>
<p class="question">
Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?
</p>
<p>
Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.
</p>
<p class="question">
What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were
perceived by listener and narrator concerning <span id="ed1961pg735"></span>themselves during the
course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?
</p><span id="ed1932pg638"></span>
<p>
By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been
celebrated 2 calendar months after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8
September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with
female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated
on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,
with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last
taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29
December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894,
aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days
during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation
of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation
of activity, mental and 
<span id="ed1922pg687"></span>
corporal, inasmuch as complete mental
intercourse <span id="ed1986pg605"></span>between himself and the listener had not taken place since
the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the
female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained
a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a
preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the
consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of
action had been circumscribed.
</p>
<p class="question">
How?
</p>
<p>
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine
destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration
for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences,
projected or effected.
</p>
<p class="question">
What moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible
thoughts?
</p>
<p>
The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of
concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.
</p>
<p class="question">
In what directions did listener and narrator lie?
</p>
<p>
Listener, S. E. by E.: Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel

to the terrestrial equator.
</p>
<p class="question">
In what state of rest or motion?
</p><span id="ed1961pg736"></span>
<p>
At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each
and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the
proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of
neverchanging space.
</p><span id="ed1932pg639"></span>
<p class="question">
In what posture?
</p>
<p>
Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right
leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the
attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator:
reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index
finger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in
the attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the
childman weary, the manchild in the womb.

He rests. He has travelled.
